            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Private debate concerning the right of an Engliſh King to Arbitrary rule over Engliſh Subjects as Succeſſor to the Norman Conquerour, (ſo called) firſt occaſioned this Diſcourſe. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have neceſſarily faln upon the Antiquity and Uniformity of the Government of this Nation: It being cleared may alſo ſerve as an Idea for them to conſider, who doe mind the reſtitution of this ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered frame of policy. For as in all orher cures, ſo in that of a diſtempered government the originall conſtitution of the body is not lightly to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and the contemplation of the proportion of the Manner of the Nation in a ſmall modell brings no leſſe furtherance to the right apprehenſion of the true nature thereof (beſides the delight) then the peruſing of a Map doth to the travailer after a long and tedious travaile.</p>
            <p>I propound not this Diſcourſe as a pattern drawn up to the life of the thing, nor the thing it ſelfe as a Maſterpiece for future ages; for well I doe know, that Common-weales in their minority doe want not onely perfection of ſtrength and beauty, but alſo of parts and proportion; eſpecially ſeeing that
<pb facs="tcp:152542:4"/> their full age attaineth no further growth then to a mixture of divers formes in one. Ambition hath done much by diſcourſe and action to bring forth Monarchy out of the wombe of notion, but yet like that of the Philoſophers ſtone the iſſue is but wind, and the end miſery to the undertakers: and therfore more then probable it is, that the utmoſt perfection of this nether worlds beſt government conſiſts in the upholding of a due proportion of ſeverall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts compounded into one temperature.</p>
            <p>He that knoweth the ſecrets of all mens hearts, doth know that my aime in this Diſcourſe is neither at Scepter or Croſier, nor after popular dotage, but that Juſtice and Truth may moderate in all. This is a Veſſell I confeſſe ill and weakly built, yet doth it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture into the vaſt Ocean of your cenſures, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who are Antiquaries, Lawyers, and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, any one of whom might have ſteered in this courſe much better then my ſelfe. Had my owne credit been the fraite, I muſt have expected nothing leſſe then wracke and loſſe of all; but the maine propoſe of this voyage being for diſcovery of the true nature of this government to common view; I ſhall ever account your juſt cenſures, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions (eſpecially publiſhed with their grounds) to be my moſt happy returne, and as a Crown to this worke. And that my labour hath its full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if others taking advantage by mine imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhal beautifie <hi>England</hi> with a more perfect and lively caracter.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He policie of Engliſh government, ſo farre as is praiſe-worthy, is all one with Divine providence, wrapped up in a vaile of Kings and wiſe men, and thus implicitely hath been delivered to the World by Hiſtorians, who for the moſt part doe read men, and weare their Pens in decyphering their perſons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: ſome of whom, having met with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Writers, ſurvive themſelves, poſſibly more famous after death then before: Others after a miſerable life waſted are yet more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in being little better then tables to ſet forth the Painters workmanſhip, and to let the World know that their Hiſtorians are more witty then themſelves of whom they wrote were either wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:152542:7"/> or good. And thus Hiſtory that ſhould be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Truth and time, becomes little better then a parable, or rather then a nonſence in a faire Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, whoſe beſt commendation is that its well written.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe Hiſtories of perſons or lives of men have their excellency in fruit, for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and continuance of fame, as a reward of vertue: yet will not the coacervation of theſe together declare the nature of a Common-weale better, then the beauty of a body diſmembred is revived by thruſting together the members, which cannot be without deformity. Nor will it be denied but many wiſe and good Kings and Queenes of this Realme may juſtly challenge the honour of paſſing many excellent Lawes, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit its the proper worke of the repreſentative body to forme them) yet to no one nor all of them can we attribute the honour of that wiſdome and goodneſſe that conſtituted this bleſſed frame of government; for ſeldome is it ſeen that one Prince buildeth upon the foundation of his predeceſſour, or purſueth his ends or aimes; becauſe as ſeverall men they have ſeverall judgements and deſires, and are ſubject to a Royall
<pb facs="tcp:152542:7"/> kind of ſelfe-love that inciteth them either to exceed former preſidents, or at leaſt to differ from them that they may not ſeem to rule by coppy as inſufficient of themſelves; which is a kind of diſparagement to ſuch as are above. Adde hereunto that its not to be conceited that the wiſeſt of our anceſtors ſaw the Idea of this government; nor was it any where in preſident but in him that determined the ſame from eternity; for as no Nation can ſhew more variety and inconſtancy in the government of Princes then this, eſpecially for three hundred yeeres next enſuing the Normans: ſo reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move imagination that theſe wheeles, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if not contrary motions, could ever conſpire into this temperature of policy, were there not ſome <hi>primum mobile</hi> that hath ever kept one conſtant motion in all.</p>
            <p>My aime therefore ſhall be to lay aſide the conſideration of man as much as may be, and to extract a ſummary view of the cardinall paſſes of the government of this Kingdome, and to glance at various aſpects of the ancient upon the moderne, that ſo theſe divers Princes and wiſe councels in their different courſe may appeare to
<pb facs="tcp:152542:8"/> be no other then the inſtruments of him that is but one, and of one mind, whoſe goings forth have been in a continuall courſe of Wiſdome and goodneſſe for our ſelves in theſe latter daies: and herein I am encouraged becauſe I am not in danger of temptation to flattery or ſpleene, nor pinched with penury of grounds of obſervation; having to doe with a Nation, then vvhich a cleerer miror of Gods gracious government is not to be found amongst all the Nations and peoples under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE, CONTAINING A Vindication of the Ancient way of the Parliament OF <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE more Words the more Faults,</hi> is a divine Maxime, that hath put a ſtop to the publiſhing of this ſecond part for ſome time; but obſerving the ordinary humor ſtill drawing off, and paſſing a harſher cenſure upon my intentions in my firſt part, then I expected: I doe proceede to fulfill my courſe, that if cenſure will be, it may be upon better grounds, when the whole matter is before: Herein I ſhall once more minde, that I meddle not with the Theologicall right of Kings, or other Powers, but with the Civill right in fact, now in hand. And becauſe ſome mens Pens of late have ranged into a denyall of the Commons ancient right in the Legiſlative power; and others, even to adnull the right, both of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons therein, reſolving all ſuch power into that one principle of a King, <hi>Quicquid libet, licet;</hi> ſo
<pb facs="tcp:152542:10"/> making the breach much wider then at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; I ſhall intend my courſe againſt both: As touching the Commons right, jointly with the Lords, it will be the maine end of the whole; but as touching the Commons right, in competition with the Lords, I will firſt endeavour to remove out of the way what I finde publiſhed in a late Tractate concerning that matter, and ſo proceede upon the whole.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of that Diſcourſe conſiſteth of three parts, one to prove that the ancient Parliaments, before the thirteenth Century, conſiſted onely of thoſe whom we now call, the Houſe of Lords; the other, that both the Legiſlative and Judiciall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Parliament reſted wholly in them: laſtly, that Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of Parliament, or the Houſe of Commons, were not knowne nor heard of, till punier times then theſe. This laſt will be granted, <hi>Viz.</hi> That theſe ſeverall titles, of Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, were not known in Parliament till of later times: Nevertheleſſe, it will be inſiſted upon, that the Commons were then there: The ſecond will be granted, but in part, <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Lords had much power in Parliament in point of Juriſdiction, but neither the ſole, nor the whole.</p>
            <p>The firſt is abſolutely denyed, neither is the ſame proved by any one inſtance or pregnant ground in all that Book, and therefore not cleerly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Hiſtories and Records beyond contradiction, as the Title page of that Book doth hold forth to the World. Firſt, becauſe not one inſtance in all that Book is excluſive to the Commons; and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:152542:10"/> the whole Argument of the Diſcourſe will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Ab authoritate Negativa,</hi> which is no argument in humane teſtimony at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the greateſt number of inſtances in that Booke, are by him ſuppoſed to concerne Parliaments, or generall Councils of this Nation, holden by the Repreſentative thereof; whereas indeed they were either but Synodicall Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Church matters, whereunto the poore Commons (he well knoweth) might not come, unleſſe in danger of the Canons dint; or if they did, yet had no other worke there, then to heare, learne, and receive Lawes, from the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks.</hi> And the Lords themſelves, though preſent, yet under no other notion were they, then as Councell to the King, whom they could not caſt out of their Councell till after Ages, though they often endeavoured it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Author of that Tractate alſo well knoweth, that Kings uſually made Grants and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feodations by advice of the Lords, without the ayde of the Parliament: And it is no leſſe true, that Kings, with the Lords, did in their ſeverall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges exerciſe ordinarily Juriſdiction, in caſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive Juſtice; eſpecially after the <hi>Norman</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: For the ſtep was eaſie from being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in Warr, to be Lords in peace; but hard to lay downe that power at the foot of Juſtice, which they had uſurped in the rude times of the Sword, when men labour for life rather then liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and no leſſe difficult to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their deportment in commanding of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and governing of Countrey-men; till peace
<pb facs="tcp:152542:11"/> by continuance had reduced them to a little more ſobriety: Nor doth it ſeeme irrationall, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate differences betweene party and party, ſhould be determined in a more private way, then to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the whole Repreſentative of the Kingdome, with matters of ſo meane concernment. If then thoſe Councils mentioned by the Author, which concerne the Kings Grants, and Infeodations, and matters of Judicature, be taken from the reſt of the Preſidents, brought by him, to maintaine the thing aimed at; I ſuppoſe ſcarce one ſtone will be left for a foundation to ſuch a glorying Structure, as is pretended in the Title page of that Booke: And yet I deny not, but where ſuch occaſions have befalne the Parliament ſitting, it hath cloſed with them, as things taken up by the way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It may be that the Author hath alſo obſerved, that all the Records of Antiquity paſſed through (if not from) the hands of the Clergy onely, and they might thinke it ſufficient for them to honour their Writings, with the great Titles of Men of Dignity in the Church and Common-wealth, omitting the Commons, as not worthy of mention, and yet they might be there then preſent, as it will appeare they were in ſome of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances enſuing, to which we come now in a more punctuall conſideration.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe by his owne words, appeare to be a Church-mote, or Synod; it was in the yeare 673. called by the Arch-Biſhop, who had no more power to ſummon a Parliament, then the Author himſelfe hath: And the ſeverall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb facs="tcp:152542:11"/> made therein, doe all ſhew that the people had no worke there, as may appeare in the ſeverall relations thereof, made by <hi>Matthew Weſtminſter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> an Author that he maketh much uſe of, and therefore I ſhall be bold to make the beſt uſe of him that I can likewiſe, in Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the truth of the point in hand: For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Councill was, its the leſſe materiall, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Author recites a preſident of King <hi>Aethelbert,</hi> within ſix yeares after <hi>Auſtins</hi> entry into this Iſland, which was long before this Councill, which bringeth on the Vann of all the reſt of the Opponents inſtances, which King called a Councill, ſtyled, <hi>Commune Concilium tam Cleri quam Populi:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 126.</note> and in the concluſion of the ſame, a Law is made upon the like occaſion, <hi>Si Rex populum Convocaverit, &amp;c.</hi> in both which its evident, that in thoſe times there were Councils holden by the People, as well as the <hi>Magnates,</hi> or <hi>Optimates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His next inſtance is in the yeare 694. which is of a Councill holden by the Great Men, but no mention of the Commons, and this he will have to be a Parliament, albeit that he might have found both Abbateſſes, or Women, and Preſbyters, to be Members of that Aſſembly, and (for default of better) atteſted the concluſions of the ſame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Canon, <hi>Nemo militans Deo, &amp;c.</hi> But I muſt alſo minde him, that the ſame Author reciteth a Councill holden by King <hi>Ina, Suaſu om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Aldermannorum &amp; Seniorum &amp; Sapientum Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni:</hi> and is very probable, that all the Wiſe men of the Kingdome, were not concluded within the Lordly dignity.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152542:12"/>
            <p>The third inſtance can have no better ſucceſſe, unleſſe he will have the Pope to be allowed power to call a Parliament, or allow the Arch-Biſhop power to doe that ſervice by the Popes command, for by that authority; this (what ever it be) was called, if we give credit to the relation of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> who alſo reciteth another Councell within three leaves foregoing this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Britt.</hi> Pag. 212.</note> called by <hi>Withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> at <hi>Barkhamſtead,</hi> unto which the Clergy were ſummoned, <hi>Qui cum viris utique militaribus communi omnium aſſenſu has leges decrevere:</hi> So as it ſeemeth in thoſe times,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> pa. 194.</note> Souldiers or Knights were in the common Councels, as well as other Great Men.</p>
            <p>In the next place, he bringeth in a Councill hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the yeare 747.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> pa. 242. 245.</note> which (if the Arch-Biſhop were then therein Preſident, as its ſayd, in the preſence of the King) was no Parliament, but a Church-mote, and all the concluſions in the ſame doe teſtifie no leſſe; they being every one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſticall matters.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 219.</note>And furthermore, before this time, the Author out of whom he citeth this Councill, mentioneth another Councill holden by <hi>Ina</hi> the Saxon King, in the preſence of the Biſhops, Princes, Lords, Earles, and all the wiſe old Men, and People of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all of them concluding of the intermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the <hi>Brittons, Picts,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> which, formerly, as it ſeemeth, was not allowed: And the ſame King by his Charter, mentioned by the ſame Penman, noteth that his endowment of the Monaſtry of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> was made, not onely in the preſence of the Great Men, but, <hi>Cum praeſentia populationis;</hi> and he ſaith, that <hi>Omnes confirmaverunt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:152542:12"/> which I doe not mention as a worke neceſſary to be done by the Parliament, yet ſuch an one as was holden expedient as the caſe then ſtood.</p>
            <p>Forty yeares after, hee meeteth with another Councill, which he ſuppoſeth to be a Parliament alſo, but was none, unleſſe he will allow the Popes Legate power to ſummon a Parliament: It was holden in the yeare, 787. and had he duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the returne made by the Popes Legate, of the Acts of that Councill,<note place="margin">Pag. 300.</note> which is alſo publiſhed by the ſame Author, hee might have found, that the Legate ſaith, that they were propounded in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Councill, before the King, Arch-Biſhop, and all the Biſhops and Abbots of the Kingdome, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, Dukes, or Captaines, and people of the Land, and they all conſented to keep the ſame.</p>
            <p>Then he brings in a Councill holden in the year, 793. which he would never have ſet downe in the liſt of Parliaments, if he had conſidered how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper it is to conſtrue, <hi>Provinciale tenuit Concilium,</hi> for a Parliament, and therefore I ſhall need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trouble the Reader therewith.</p>
            <p>The two next are ſuppoſed to be but one and the ſame; and its ſayd to be holden, <hi>Anno</hi> 974. before nine Kings, fifteene Biſhops, twenty Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which for ought appeares, may comprehend all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is no Parliament of one Nation, but a party of many Nations, for ſome great matter, no doubt, yet nothing in particular mentioned, but the ſolemne laying the foundation of the Monaſtry of <hi>Saint-Albans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What manner of Councill the next was, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not, and therefore nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb facs="tcp:152542:13"/> therefrom, but that it was holden in the yeare, 796.</p>
            <p>That Councill which is next produced, was in the yeare, 800. and is called in great letters, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium Provinciale,</hi> which he cannot Gramatically conſtrue to be a Parliament; yet in the Preface it is ſayd, that there were, <hi>Viri cujuſcunque dignitatis;</hi> and the King in his Letter to the Pope, ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it,<note place="margin">Pag. 321.</note> 
               <hi>Viſum eſt cunctis gentis noſtrae ſapientibus;</hi> ſo as it ſeemeth by this, and other examples of this nature, that though the Church-motes invented the particular concluſions, yet it was left to the Witagen-mote to Judge and conclude them.</p>
            <p>There can be no queſtion, but the next three Preſidents brought by the Opponent, were all of them Church-motes:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 328.</note> For the firſt of them, which is ſayd to be holden in the yeare, 816. is called a Synod, and both Preiſts and Deacons were there preſent, which are no Members of Parliament, conſiſting onely of the Houſe of Lords, and they all of them did, <hi>Pariter tractare de neceſſarijs &amp; uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatibus Eccleſiarum.</hi> The ſecond of them is called a Synodall Councill, holden, <hi>Anno</hi> 822. and yet there were then preſent, <hi>Omnium dignitatum opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> which cannot be underſtood onely of thoſe of the Houſe of Lords, becauſe they ought all to be perſonally preſent, and therefore there is no Optimacy amongſt them. The laſt of theſe three is called, <hi>Synodale Conciliabulum,</hi> a petty Synod in great letters;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 334.</note> and beſides, there were with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Abbots, many Wiſe men; and in all theſe reſpects it cannot be a Parliament onely of the great Lords.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152542:13"/>
            <p>The next Councill ſaid to be holden in the yeare 823. cannot alſo be called properly a Parliament, but onely a conſultation, between two Kings and their Councill, to prevent the invaſion of the Danes; and the atteſts of the Kings Chapplain, and his Scribe, doe ſhew alſo that they were not all Members of the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>The Councill cited by the Opponent in the next place, was holden, An: 838. being onely in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Councill for Law, or Judicature, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the validity of the Kings Grant made to the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which is no proper worke for a Parliament, unleſſe it befall during the ſitting of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The next is but a bare title of a Councill ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be holden, An. 850. And not worth its room, for it neither ſheweth whether any thing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, nor what the concluſions were.</p>
            <p>The worke of the next Councill alleadged to be holden, An. 851. was to confirme the Charter of the Monaſtry of <hi>Croyland,</hi> and to determine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affaires belonging to the <hi>Mercians;</hi> and if it had beene a Parliament for that people, it might be worthy of inquiry how regularly the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from the Weſt Saxons could fit amongſt them and atteſt the concluſions therein made, as wel as the proper members of that Nation.</p>
            <p>He commeth in the next place to a Councill hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the yeare, 855. which is more likely to be a Parliament then moſt of them formerly mentioned; if the Tithes of all <hi>England</hi> were therein given to the Church, but hereof I have ſet downe my opinion in
<pb facs="tcp:152542:14"/> the former part of the diſcourſe. And though it be true, that no Knights and Burgeſſes are therein mentioned, as the Opponent obſerveth out of the Title; yet if the body of the Lawes be duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, towards the concluſion thereof it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that there was preſent, <hi>Fidelium infinita mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo qui omnes regium Chirographum Laudaverunt Dignitates verò ſua nomina ſubſcripſerunt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 350.</note> And yet the Witagen-motes in theſe times began to be rare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually inrerrupted by the invaſions of the Danes.</p>
            <p>The three next Councills alleaged to be in the yeares 930. 944. 948. Were doubtleſſe of inferiour value, as the matters therin concluded were of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour regard, being ſuch as concerne the paſſing of the Kings Grants, Infeodations, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The Councill mentioned to be in the yeare 965. is ſuppoſed to be one and the ſame with the next foregoing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Brit.</hi> Pag. 480.</note> by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> which calls it ſelfe a generall Councill, not by reaſon of the generall confluence of the Lords and Laity, but becauſe all the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> did then meet. The <hi>Primi</hi> and <hi>Primates</hi> were there, who theſe were is not mentioned; but its evident that the King of Scots was there, and that both he and diverſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Miniſtri Regis,</hi> atteſted the concluſions: It will be difficult to make out how theſe ſhould be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Lords, and more difficult to ſhew a reaſon why in the atteſting of the acts of theſe Councills which the Opponent calls Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we finde ſo few of the Laity that ſcarce twelve are mentioned in any one of them, and
<pb facs="tcp:152542:14"/> thoſe to deſcend ſo low as the <hi>Miniſtri Regis,</hi> to make up the number.</p>
            <p>Five more of theſe inſtances remaine, before the comming in of the <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of which was in the yeare 975. and in a time when no Parliament,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Concil. Britt.</hi> Pag. 490.</note> according to the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents principles could ſit, for it was an <hi>Inter reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two next were onely Synods to determine the difference between the Regulers, and the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in the Kings abſence, by reaſon that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age; and they are ſayd to be in the yeares 977 and 1009. But its not within the compaſſe of my matter to debate their dates.</p>
            <p>The laſt two were Meetings or Courts for Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, to determine the crime of Treaſon, which every one knowes is determinable by inferiour Courts before the high Steward or Judges, and therefore not ſo peculiar to a Parliament, as to be made an argument of its exiſtence. And thus are we at an end of all the inſtances brought by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, to prove that Parliaments before the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> times conſiſted of thoſe whom we now call the Houſe of Lords. All which I ſhall ſhut up with two other notes taken out of the Book of Councils, publiſhed by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of which concerneth a Grant made by <hi>Canutus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 534.</note> of an exemption to the Abby of <hi>Bury</hi> Saint <hi>Edmonds,</hi> in a Councill wherein, were preſent Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Dukes, Earles. <hi>Cum quamplurimis gregariis militibus, cum populi multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne copioſa votis regiis unanimiter conſentientes.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken out of the confeſſors Lawes, which tells

               <note place="margin">Pag. 621.</note> And thus ſhall leave theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to debate with one another, whiles the Reader may judge as ſeemeth moſt equall to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Being thus come to the <hi>Norman</hi> times, and thoſe enſuing; I ſhall more ſummarily proceed with the particulars concerning them, becauſe they were times of force, and can give little or no evidence againſt the cuſtomes rightly ſetled in the Saxon times, which I have more particularly inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the originall conſtitution of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may the better appeare. Now for the more ſpeedy manifeſting of the truth in the particulars following; I ſhall pre-adviſe the Reader in three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Church-motes grew more in power and honor, by the aide of the <hi>Normans</hi> Law, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the concurrence and perſonall preſence of Kings, whom at length they excluded from their Councils with all his Nobles; and therefore it is the leſſe wonder if we heare but little of the Commons joyning with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the <hi>Norman</hi> way of government grew more Ariſtocraticall then the Saxon, making the Lords the cheif Inſtruments of keeping Kings above and people underneath, &amp; thus we meet with much noiſe of meetings betweene the King and Lords, and little concernning the grand meetings of the Kings, and the repreſentative of the people; although ſome footſteps wee finde even of them alſo. For Kings were miſtaken in the Lords; who meaned nothing leſſe them to ſerve them with the peoples
<pb facs="tcp:152542:15"/> liberties, together with their owne which they ſaw wrapped up in the groſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by this meanes the Councils of the King and Lords grew potent, not onely for adviſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions, but in matters of judicature, and declaring of Law, ordering of proceſſe in Courts of Plees; which in the firſt framing were the workes of Wiſe and Learned men, but being once ſetled become part of the liberties of every Free-man. And it is not to be doubted but theſe Councills of Lords did outreach into things two great for them to mannage, and kept the Commons out of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their right, during the preſent heat of their ruffling condition, yet all this while could not take abſolute poſſeſſion of the legiſlative power.</p>
            <p>I now come to the remainder of the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances produced by the Opponent, which I ſhall reduce into ſeverall Categories, for the more cleere ſatisfaction to the Reader, with leſſe tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it cannot be denied but the Councill of Lords gave adviſe to Kings in caſes of particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency, nor is it incongruous to the courſe of government even to this day, nor meere that the Parliament ſhould be troubled with every ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and therefore the giving of adviſe to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, what courſe he ſhould take to ſettle the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> according to the inſtances in Councills holden, An: 1060. And 1070. And to gaine favour of the great men according to that in An: 1106. and in the manner of endowment of the Abby of <hi>Battell,</hi> as in pag: 25. of the Opponents diſcourſe: and what to do upon the reading of the
<pb facs="tcp:152542:16"/> Popes Letter, according to that in An: 1114. And whether the Popes Legate ſhould be admitted, as in pag. 18. And how King <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> ſhall come to agreement, as An: 1153. And how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Lawes by Judges and Juſtices <hi>Itinerant,</hi> as An: 1176. And touching the manner of ingageing for a voyage by <hi>Croiſado</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> An: 1189. And to give anſwer to Embaſſadors of a forraine Prince, pag. 25. And how King <hi>John</hi> ſhall conclude peace with the Pope, An: 1213. Where never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe <hi>Math. Paris</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> was <hi>Turba multa nimis:</hi> I ſay all theſe might well be done by a Councell of Lords, and not in any poſture of a Parliament; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that in none of all theſe doth any thing appeare but that the Commons might be preſent in every one, or many of them all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as touching judicature, the Lords had much power therein, even in the Saxon times, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better opportunites for Knowledge, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially joyned with the Clergy, then the Commons in thoſe times of deep darkneſſe, wherein even the Clergy wanted not their ſhare, as in the firſt part of the diſcourſe I have already obſerved. Whatſoever then might be done by Judges in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courts of judicature, is inferiour to the regard of the Parliament; and therefore the Plea between the Arch-Biſhop and <hi>Aethelſtan,</hi> concerning Land, inſtanced, An: 1070. And betweene <hi>Lanfranke</hi> and <hi>Odo, An:</hi> 1071. <hi>and betweene the King and Anſelme, pag:</hi> 15, 16. and the determining of Treaſon <hi>of John</hi> (afterwards King) againſt his Lord and King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> pag: 23. And the difference concerning the title of a <hi>Barony</hi> between <hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Scotvile,</hi> pag:
<pb facs="tcp:152542:16"/> 25. And giving of ſecurity of good behaviour by <hi>William Brawſe</hi> to King <hi>John,</hi> pag. 26. All theſe might well be determined onely before the Lords, and yet the Parliament might be then ſitting or not ſitting, as the contrary to either doth not appeare, and therefore can theſe forme no demonſtrative ground to prove that the Parliament conſiſted in thoſe times, onely of ſuch as we now call the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>A third worke whereby the Opponent would prove the Parliament to conſiſt onely of the Houſe of Lords, is, becauſe hee findeth many things by them concluded touching the ſolemnization, and the ſettling of the ſucceſſion of Kings; both which, he ſaith, were done by the Lords in Parliament, or thoſe of that Houſe; and I ſhall crave leave to conclude the contrary: For neither is the election, or Solemnization of ſuch election, a proper worke of the Parliament, according to the Opponents principles, nor can they prove ſuch Conventions, wherein they were to be Parliaments. Not the election of Kings, for then may a Parliament be without a King; and therefore that inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>William Rufus, page</hi> 16. will faile, or the Opponents principles, who will have no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a King.</p>
            <p>The like may alſo be ſayde of the inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning King <hi>Steven, page</hi> 18. Much leſſe can the ſolemnization of the election by Coronation, be a proper worke for the Parliament: Nevertheleſſe the Opponent doth well know that both the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a King, and the ſolemnization of ſuch ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by Coronation, are Spiritleſſe motions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:152542:17"/> the preſence of the people; and therefore though his inſtance, <hi>page</hi> 17. concerning the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, by the Biſhops and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may ſeeme to be reſtrictive as to them, yet it is not ſuch in fact; if <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> may be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Seldens Title of Honor.</note> who telleth us, that in the <hi>Conventus omnium,</hi> was <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus univerſus,</hi> and might have been noted by the Opponent out of that <hi>Learned Antiquary,</hi> ſo often by him cited, if he had pleaſed to take notice of ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>A fourth ſort of Inſtances, concerneth matters Eccleſiaſticall, and making of Canons; and hereof enough hath been already ſayd, that ſuch worke was abſolutely challenged by the Church-motes, as their proper worke; and therefore the Inſtance, <hi>page</hi> 16, 17. of the Councill in <hi>Henry</hi> the firſts time, and the Canons made by the Biſhops there; and that other called by <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and inſtanced by the Opponent, <hi>page</hi> 19. I ſay, both theſe doe faile in the concluſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As touching the moſt proper worke of Parliaments, which is, the making of Lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the liberties and benefit of the people; the Opponent produceth not one inſtance concerning the ſame, which doth not conclude contrary to his propoſall; for as touching thoſe two inſtances in his thirteenth page, <hi>Anno</hi> 1060. they concerne not the making of Lawes, but the reviving of ſuch as had been difuſed formerly, which might well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be done by private Councell. But as to that in his fifteenth page, of the Law made by the Conquerour, concerning <hi>Remigius,</hi> Biſhop of
<pb facs="tcp:152542:17"/> 
               <hi>Lincolne,</hi> although it be true, that wee finde not the particular titles of Knights, Citizens, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, yet beſides the Councill of Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbats, and Princes, we finde the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councill; for ſo the words are, <hi>Communi Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio, &amp; Concilio Archiepiſcopus, Epiſcopus, Abatus, &amp; omnium Principum,</hi> although the Opponent would ſeeme to wave theſe words, <hi>Et Concilio,</hi> but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in a ſmall Character, and the reſt in a voluminous Letter, that the Readers eyes might be filled with them and overlook the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as to the inſtance of the Councill at <hi>Clarindon,</hi> in his nineteenth <hi>page,</hi> which he citeth out of <hi>Matthew Paris, Matthew Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> although he pleaſeth to mention the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall rankes of Great Men, and thoſe in blacke Letters of a greater ſize; and ſaith, That not one Commoner appeares, yet Maſter <hi>Seldens Hoveden,</hi> in that very place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit. Honor,</hi> Pag. 703.</note> ſo often by the Opponent ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tells him, that both <hi>Clerus</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> were there.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Opponent citeth an inſtance of Lawes made by <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, in his twenty fourth <hi>page,</hi> and hee ſetteth downe the ſeverall ranks of Great Men, and amongſt the reſt, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly mentioneth, <hi>Milites,</hi> but it is with a Gloſſe of his owne, that they were Barons that were made Knights, when as formerly Barons were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the generall, and therefore how proper this Gloſſe is, let others judge; eſpecially ſeeing that not onely <hi>Milites,</hi> and <hi>Milites Gregorij,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Miniſtri,</hi> were preſent in ſuch conventions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Saxon times: And Maſter <hi>Selden</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:152542:18"/> former knowne place, mentioneth an Obſervation, that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit. Honor,</hi> Pag. 703.</note> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi perſonae qui de Rege tenent in Capite, ſicut ceteri Barones debent intereſſe judicijs curiae Domini Regis cum Baronibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, He citeth in his twenty fifth <hi>page,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inſtance in King <hi>Johns</hi> time, in which, after the aſſent of Earles, and Barons, the words, <hi>Et om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium fidelium noſtrorum,</hi> are alſo annexed, but with this conceit of the Opponents, that theſe <hi>Fideles</hi> were thoſe that adhered to the King, againſt his enemies; be it ſo, for then the Commons were preſent, and did aſſent; or they may be, ſaith he, ſome ſpecially ſummoned as Aſſiſtants; take that alſo, and then all the true hearted in the Kingdome were ſpecially ſummoned and were there, ſo as the concluſion will be the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the fifth place, hee citeth a ſtrange Preſident (as he calls it) of a Writt of Summons in King <hi>Johns</hi> time, in his twenty ſeventh <hi>page,</hi> wherein <hi>Omnes miletes</hi> were ſummoned, <hi>Cum armis ſuis,</hi> and he concludes therefore the ſame was a Councell of Warr.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe they were to come armed, its very true, and ſo they did unto the Councills in the ancient Saxon times, and ſo the Knights of the Counties ought to doe in theſe dayes, if they obey the Writte, <hi>Duos Milites gladijs cinctas, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaith, That the Knights were not to come to Councill; that is his opinion, yet the Writt ſpeakes, that the <hi>Diſcreti Milites</hi> were to come, <hi>Ad loquendum cum Rege ad negotijs regni:</hi> Its true, ſaith hee, but not, <hi>Ad tractandum &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum
<pb facs="tcp:152542:18"/> &amp; conſentiendum:</hi> Its true, its not ſo ſayd, nor is it excluded; and were it ſo, yet the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents concluſion will not thence ariſe, That none but the King, and thoſe who are of the Houſe of Lords were there preſent.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and laſt inſtance mentioned by the Opponent, is in his thirtieth <hi>page,</hi> and concerneth Eſcuage granted to King <hi>John,</hi> who by his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted, that in ſuch caſes he would ſummon Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Earles, and the greater Barons, unto ſuch Conventions by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Writts, and that the Sheriffe ſhall ſummon promiſcuouſly all others which hold in <hi>Capite;</hi> and thence hee concludes, That none but the Great Lords, and the Tenants in <hi>Capite</hi> (whom he calls the leſſer Barons) were preſent, but no Knights, Citizens, or Burgeſſes; all which being granted, yet in full Parliament the Citizens and Burgeſſes might be there. For Councills were called of ſuch perſons as ſuited to the matter to be debated upon.</p>
            <p>If for matters purely Eccleſiaſticall, the King and his Councell of Lords, and the Church-men made up the Councill.</p>
            <p>If for advice in immergencies, the King and ſuch Lords as were next at hand determined the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
            <p>If for Eſcuage, the King and ſuch as were to pay Eſcuage, made up a Councill to aſcertaine the ſum, which was otherwiſe uncertaine.</p>
            <p>If for matters that concerned the common li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, all ſorts were preſent,<note place="margin">Littlet. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> as may appeare out
<pb facs="tcp:152542:19"/> of the very Charter of King <hi>John,</hi> noted in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Britt.</hi> Pa. 122.</note> 
               <hi>page,</hi> 258. and alſo from an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Cambden,</hi> concerning <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Ad ſummum honorem pertinet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Ex quo Rex Henricus tertius, ex tanta multitudine quae ſeditioſa ac turbulenta fuit optimos quoſque ad Commitia Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaria evocaverit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Opponent takes that for granted that never will be, <hi>Viz.</hi> That all the Kings Tenants <hi>In Capite,</hi> were of the Houſe of Lords; when as himſelfe acknowledgeth a difference, <hi>page</hi> 28. <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Barons are ſummoned by Writs, <hi>Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> as all the Members of the Houſe of Lords are, but theſe are by generall ſummons, their number great, and hard it will be to underſtand, how, or when, they came to be excluded from that Society.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt no further upon the particulars of this Tractate, but demurr upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and leave it to judgement upon the premiſes, which might have beene much better reduced to the maine concluſion, if the Opponent, in the firſt place, had defined the word <hi>PARLIAMENT:</hi> For if it was a Convention without the People, and ſometimes without the <hi>KING,</hi> as in the Caſes formerly mentioned, of the Elections of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and of <hi>King Steven:</hi> And if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Parliament of Lords onely, may be againſt the King, and ſo without King or People; as in the Caſe betweene <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:152542:19"/> and the caſe likewiſe concerning King <hi>John,</hi> both which alſo were formerly mentioned; poſſibly it may be thought as rationall for the Commons in after Ages, to hold a Parliament without King, or Houſe of Lords; and then all the Opponents la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is to little purpoſe.</p>

Barbarians they were, and ſo eſteemed by the Romans that were but refined Barbarians themſelves; and yet they worſhipped an Inviſible, Infinite,<note place="margin">Tacit. Anal. 14. Amian. lib 15. Caeſ. com. lib. 6 Tacit.</note> Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God by Sacrifices: but the greateſt part of their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence fell ſhort, and reſted upon their Prieſts, whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the onely Secretaries that God had on earth, feared their interdict worſe then death it ſelfe, and (in theſe times of uttermoſt darkneſſe) held them forth to neighbouring Nations,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152542:21"/> to inſtruct them into an higher excellency then that of brutiſh men.</p>
               <p>In their civill Government they allowed preeminence to their Magiſtrates rather then Supremacy, and had many chiefes in a little roome; the Romans called them little Kings, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter renown of their Empire: but others of more ſobriety account them no better then Lords.<note place="margin">Caeſ. com. lib. 5</note> Of liberties not much exceeding thoſe of a City; and theſe (though in time of peace independant upon each other, yea perpetuall enemies, yet) in time of forraine war, joyned together to chuſe one head to command them all, according to the cuſtome of the Germans,<note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> noteth. But that which yet cleareth the matter, is the teſtimony of <hi>Dion</hi> in the life of <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour, who expreſly ſaith, that in <hi>Britaine</hi> the people held the helme of Government in their own power, ſo as theſe were not Kings nor their government Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, and yet might be regular enough, conſidering the rudeneſſe that in thoſe daies overſpread the World.

                  <note place="margin">Hieron.</note> the word being taken <hi>mitiori ſenſu,</hi> or from a common repute of exceſſive cruelty or oppreſſion by ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Concerning the converſion of the Britons unto the Faith.</head>
               <p>IT was long before the Sonne of God was inwombed, and whiles as yet Providence ſeemed to cloſe onely with the Jewiſh Nation, and to hover over it, as a choice picked place from all the earth, that with a gracious eye ſurveying the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken condition of other Nations it glanced upon this Iſland; both thoughts and words reflected on Iſles, Iſles of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.4.51.5.60.9.66.19.</note> Iſles afar off, as if amongſt them the Lord of all the earth had found out one place that ſhould be to him as the Gemme of the ring of this Terreſtriall Globe: and if the waies of future providence may be looked upon as a gloſſe of thoſe Propheſies: we muſt confeſſe that this Iſland was conceived in the wombe thereof long before it was manifeſted to the world.</p>
               <p>To recover the forgotten waies of paſt providence is no leſſe difficult then to ſearch out the hidden bowels of future promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore I ſhall not buſie my ſelfe to finde out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtruments that brought Gods preſence into this dark corner; but onely glance at the time and manner, that it may appeare we were not forgotten, nor yet laſt, or leaſt in mind, at that time of the diſpenſation of this grace unto all men. I dare not inſtance as <hi>Gildas,</hi> the certaine time of ſix yeeres; yet I may ſay, that no ſooner was the Scepter departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> but with a ſwift pace both it and the Lawgiver came hither like an Arrow flying through other Countries, but ſticking with a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> in this Iſland (then a People rather then a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale) as if we were the onely white that then was in Gods aime. Its probable in the higheſt degree that the worke was done within the firſt Century, and very nigh about the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike times; for that in the ſecond Century <hi>Britaine</hi> was a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152542:22"/> Church of Fame, and known to the Fathers that dwelt afarre off, even to <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> and in a ſhort time had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached the Roman confines in that Iſland (which had coſt them above two hundred yeeres travaile) and was grown to the ſtate of the firſt Chriſtian Kingdome that ever was:<note place="margin">Tertul. adv. Judaeos.</note> unto which, if we ſhall allow time for the gathering and growth thereof unto this royall pitch, proportionable to the halfe of that which afterward was ſpent in the like worke, upon the Saxon and Daniſh Kings, we muſt in reaſon conclude that the worke was firſt ordered by Apoſtolicall direction, or ſome of their emiſſaries. Cuſtomes alſo do not obſcurely declare ages. For before that <hi>Pius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> began to ſpeake in the big language of Decrees, it was indifferent to keepe Eaſter either upon the day obſerved by the Roman Church, or on the day according to the Jewes cuſtome; and although the Roman Church began within fifty yeeres after the death of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt,<note place="margin">Platina. de vit. Eleuthe.</note> to ſtickle to impoſe their cuſtome upon other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; yet the Church of <hi>Britaine</hi> conformed not to that courſe by the ſpace of five hundred yeeres after that time; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth probability,<note place="margin">Beda. l. 3. cap. 25.</note> that the Church was there ſetled in times of indifferency, not by Roman order, but by ſome other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meſſenger.</p>
               <p>The manner yet is more remarkable, for that not onely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and Powers, and Spirituall wickedneſſes in high places (which are but ſtumbling-blocks) but alſo naturall wiſdome of the Druides, who were maſters of the conſciences of the Britons, and their high conceipt of their excellency above the ordinary ſtraine of men, and unto which the Croſſe of Chriſt is meere fooliſhneſſe; and above all, the deep oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people unto theſe their Rabbies, in a devotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of other Nations; all theſe, I ſay, ſtood in the way, and rendred the people more uncapable of any new light. But when the time fore-ſet is fully come, all mountaines are laid low, and double-folded doores fly open; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of all Nations attempts <hi>Britaine</hi> not in the reare, nor by undermining, but aſſailes them in their full ſtrength, preſents in a cleare Sunſhine that one true Sacrifice of God man; at the appearing whereof their ſhadowes of many Sacrifices of mans

               <p>THis converſion of the Druides was but the firſt ſtep to that which followed; for the Decree was more full of grace then to make this Iſle to be onely as an Inne for him to whom it was formerly given for a poſſeſſion;<note place="margin">Pſ. 2.8.</note> The Romans are called in to the worke, under whoſe Iron yoke God had ſubdued all Nations, thereby more ſpeedily to bring to paſſe his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, both of that one head, and all its members. The firſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> had entred <hi>Britaine</hi> before the Incarnation, and having ſeen and ſaluted it, and played his prize,<note place="margin">Tacit.</note> returned with the fame onely of conqueſt of ſome few Lordſhips neighbouring to the Belgicke ſhore; and ſo it continued correſpondent to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, or rather forgotten of them till the time of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Vit. Agric.</note> who being at leaſure to bethink him of the Britons tribute, or rather aſpiring to honour by a way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly untroden by his Anceſtors, firſt ſetled Colonies in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and brought it into the forme of a Province, and ingaged his ſucceſſors in a continuall war to perfect that worke, which outwearied their ſtrength at laſt, and made them forgoe the prey, as too heavy for the Eagle to truſſe and carry away.</p>
               <p>It oft befals that things of deformed ſhape are nevertheleſſe of excellent ſpirit, and ſerve the turne beſt of all: and it is no leſſe remarkable, that this tyde of Roman invaſion, however it repreſented to the world little other then a tumour of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory in the Romans that muſt needs be fatall to the Britons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152542:23"/> liberty and welfare: yet by over-ruling providence it conduced ſo much to the Britons future glory, as it muſt be acknowledged one of the chiefe maſter-pieces of ſupernaturall moderatorſhip that ever this poore Iſland met with. Firſt, it taught them to beare the yoke, to ſtoop, and become tractable; for ſtubborne ſpirits muſt firſt ſtoop under power, before they will ſtoop to inſtruction; but this onely in the way; for tractableneſſe, if good enſue not, is of it ſelfe but a diſpoſition for evill. Secondly, it brought into <hi>Britaine</hi> the knowledge of Arts and civility; and queſtionleſſe it was a wiſe policy of <hi>Agricola</hi> to goe that way to worke;<note place="margin">Tacit. vit. Agric.</note> for its an eaſie and Royall worke to governe wiſe men, but to governe fooles or mad men is a continuall ſlavery; and thus religion already ſetled in <hi>Britaine</hi> became honoured with a traine of attendants, and handmaids. Thirdly, they reduced the number of little Lordſhips nigher to the more honourable eſtate of Monarchy: for the Romans by deere experience fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no ſtability or aſſurance in what they had gotten, ſo long as ſo many petty Kings had the rule; they wiſely brought the whole into one Province (becauſe it is much eaſier to governe many ſubordinate each to other, then co-ordinate one with another) over which they allowed one chiefe, to rule the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to their own Lawes, ſaving their ſervice to the Romans and their Lieutenants, untill they were neceſſitated to yeeld up all to the next occupant: This ſerved the Britiſh Church with a double intereſt. For firſt, Religion ſpreads ſooner under one uniform government, then under variety; and under Monarchy, rightly ordered, rather then any other government whatſoever; albeit that other governments may afford it faſter footing when it is entred. Secondly, <hi>Rome</hi> was a renowned Church throughout the world for gifts and graces; and it is obvious to conceive that it was ſpecially purpoſed by divine providence to make that place a fountaine, that from thence the knowledge of Chriſt might convey it ſelfe joyntly with the influence of Imperiall power, as the ſpirits with the blood, into all Nations of that vaſt body.</p>
               <p>Above one hundred yeeres were ſpent in this Provinciall way of government of <hi>Britaine</hi> under the Roman Lieutenants; during all which time Religion ſpread under ground, whiles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152542:23"/> the Roman power in a continuall war ſprang upward: Nor is it ſtrange that Religion ſhould thrive in warre; the French wars in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time brought much of this happineſſe to <hi>England</hi> from the Waldenſes; and <hi>Germany</hi> had no leſſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the wars of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth with the Italians, French, and Turks: and thus the Romans levened with the Goſpell, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing men with <hi>Britaine,</hi> and other mutuall correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies inſinuated that leven by degrees, which in the concluſion prevailed over all.</p>
               <p>For the Roman Lieutenants having gotten ſure footing in <hi>Britaine,</hi> ſteered their courſe with a different hand; generally they were of the Roman ſtampe, ſeeking to kill Chriſt in the Cradle; and by that meanes Religion met with many bitter ſtorms of bitter perſecution, and ſo was compelled to beare a low ſaile; but ſome being more debonaire, and of wiſer obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſoon found, that the way of juſtice and gentleneſſe had more force in <hi>Britaine</hi> then Armes, and ſo endeavoured to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that by moderation which they had gotten by labour and blood (as it is ever ſeen that where conqueſt is in the van, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe follows in the reare, becauſe no Bow can ſtand long bent but at length muſt give in and grow weake.) And thus by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance the Britons got a little more ſcope, and Religion more encouragement, till it became acquainted with the Roman De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, began to treat with the Emperours themſelves, and under the wiſe government of <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Emperour moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Brittiſh throne, crowned <hi>Lucius</hi> firſt of all Kings with the Royall Title of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>He now not ſo much a vaſſall as a friend, and ally to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and perceiving the Empire to be paſt noon, and their Lieutenants to comply with the Chriſtians, began to provide for future generations, and according to the two grand defects of Religion and Juſtice, applied himſelfe for the eſtabliſhment of both.</p>
               <p>Religion in <hi>Britaine</hi> hath hitherto been for the moſt part maintained by immediate influence from Heaven. No Schools, no learning, either maintained or deſired, the want whereof, together with the perſecutions ſtirred up by the Emperours, eſpecially <hi>Domitian,</hi> brought the Church to ſo low an ebbe that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152542:24"/> the Sacraments ceaſed; for Hiſtories tell us that <hi>Lucius</hi> ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for reliefe and that the Biſhop of that place (whether <hi>Evariſtus</hi> or <hi>Eleutherius</hi>) ſent over learned men to preach and baptize both King and people; and in this, <hi>Rome</hi> might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gaine ſome honour,<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. an. 181.</note> although poſſibly the King intended it not, or muchleſſe to acknowledge any authority or power in that Church over that of <hi>Britaine.</hi> This act of <hi>Lucius</hi> ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him in the opinion of writers, that they know not when they have ſaid enough; Some will have him to be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt entry of Religion into this Iſle: others, that he ſetled a forme of Church-government under the three Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops of <hi>London, Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Caerlion</hi> upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ske,</hi> and 28 Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks; the firſt of which is cried down by many demonſtrative inſtances, nor can it conſiſt with the ſecond, nor that with it, or with the truth of other ſtories. For it neither can be made out that <hi>Lucius</hi> had that large circuit within his Dominion; nor that the title of Archbiſhop was in his daies known; and tis very improbable that the Britiſh Church was ſo numerous, or that Religion in his time was overſpread the whole Iſland: nor is there any mention in any Authour of any Monuments of theſe Archbiſhops or Biſhops of <hi>Britaine</hi> for the ſpace of 200 yeeres after this Kings reign, and yet no continuall raging perſecution (that we read of) that ſhould enforce them to obſcure their profeſſion, or hide their heads: or if ſuch times had been, it would have been expected that Biſhops in thoſe daies ſhould be in <hi>Britaine</hi> (as well as in other places) moſt famous for gifts and graces, and paſſe in the forefront of perſecution. But we finde no ſuch thing; no not in the rages of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which made the Britiſh Church famous for Martyrs: Writers ſpeake of <hi>Alban, Amphibalus, Aron, Julius,</hi> and a multitude of Lay-people, but do not mention one Biſhop, nor Presbyter, nor other Clergyman,<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. an. 303.</note> but <hi>quendam Clericum,</hi> a man it ſeems of no note, and of unknown name. In charity therefore the Engliſh Church in thoſe daies muſt be of mean repute for outward pompe; and not lifted up to that height of Archbiſhops, when as <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe was content with a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Somewhat more probable it is, that is noted by writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lucius</hi> his endeavour to ſettle the Common-wealth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152542:24"/> and good Lawes for government, and to that end did write a Letter to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for a modell of the Roman Lawes; probably being induced thereunto by the ſplendor of the ſtate of the Roman Church and Common-weale; the onely favourite of fame in thoſe times through the Northern parts of the World. Things afar off I confeſſe are dim, and its meet that Antiquaries ſhould have the honour due to great after-ſight. And therfore I might think (as ſome of them have done) that the Epiſtle of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to King <hi>Lucius</hi> is ſpurious, if I could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to what end any man ſhould hazzard his wits upon ſuch a fiction; or if the incongruities charged againſt it were incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but being allowed to be firſt written in Latine, and then tranſlated into Britiſh for the peoples ſatisfaction; and in that Language (the originall being loſt) traduced to poſterity; and then by ſome Latine writer in after ages returned into Latine, and ſo derived to theſe times (all which very probably hath been) ſuch occaſions of exceptions might well ariſe by miſtake of tranſlators and tranſcribers in ignorant times, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance nevertheleſſe remaine entire and true. Conſidering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the matter of that Epiſtle ſavoureth of the purer times of the Church, and ſo contrary to the dregs of <hi>Romulus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. Attic. 2.</note> I meane, the policy, practice and language of the Roman Clergy, in theſe latter ages, wherein this forgery (if ſo it be) was made; I muſt allow it to paſſe for currant for the ſubſtance, not juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſyllabicall writing thereof.</p>
               <p>To others it ſeemeth needleſſe and vaine that <hi>Lucius</hi> ſhould ſend for a modell to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> when as the Roman Deputies and Legions at home might have ſatisfied the Kings deſire in that particular, or their owne experience might have taught them grounds ſufficient, after two hundred yeeres converſe with the Romans, that they ſhould have little needed a model for that which they ſaw continually before their view, or might have underſtood by inquiry of their own acquaintance. But what could be expected of rough ſouldiers concerning forme of government of a Common-weale? or if ſome excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ordinary ſtraine in policy, yet they were too wiſe to communicate ſuch Pearles to conquered Nations, that ought to look no higher then the will of the Conquerour, and ſubſiſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152542:25"/> in no better condition then may be controlled by the Supreame Imperiall Law of the Lord <hi>Paramount:</hi> or if in this they had correſponded to the deſires of the Britaines, yet being for the moſt part ignorant of the maine, they could never have ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the expectations of a Chriſtian King, who deſires ſuch a Law as may befriend Religion, and wherein no man was more like to give direction then <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> who ſeeing a kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the Roman Lawes, and Chriſts Kingdom, ſends to the King a fair refuſall of his requeſt upon this ground, that <hi>leges Romanas &amp; Caeſaris ſemper reprobare poſsumus;</hi> he ſaw that they were not well grounded; he therefore refers the King to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, that is truth it ſelfe. Lawes that come nigheſt to it are moſt conſtant, and make the government more eaſie for the Magiſtrate, quiet for the people, and delightfull to all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mens minds are ſetled in expectation of future events in government according to the preſent rule; and changes in courſe of government are looked at as uncouth motions of the Celeſtiall bodies, portending judgements or diſſolution. This was the way of humane wiſdome; but God had an eye on all this beyond all reach of preconceipt of man, which was to make <hi>England</hi> happy in the enjoying of a better Law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then <hi>Rome,</hi> how glorious ſoever then it was; and to deliver that Iſland from the common danger of the world; for had we once come under the law of the firſt beaſt, as we were under his power; we had been in danger of being borne ſlaves under the Law of the ſecond beaſt, as other Nations were, who cannot ſhake it off to this day.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucius</hi> lived not to effect this worke; it was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by the evill of the times; nothing was more changeable then the Empire grew; the Emperours many of them ſo vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as they were a burden to mankind; nor could they endure any Deputy or Lieutenant that were of better fame then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had. Some of them minded the affaires of the Eaſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the North; none of them were <hi>ad omnia:</hi> And the Lieutenants in <hi>Britaine</hi> either too good for their Emperour, and ſo were ſoon removed; or too bad for the people of the Land, and never ſuffered to reſt free from tumults and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: neither <hi>Lucius</hi> could prevaile, nor any of his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152542:25"/> But paſſing through continuall croſſe flouds of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under <hi>Maximinus, Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximinianus,</hi> and many civill broyles, till the times of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> at length it attained the haven.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> having overcome <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and gotten thereby into the higheſt Orbe of government in the Empire; reflected ſuch an amiable aſpect upon the Churches, eſpecially in <hi>Britaine,</hi> as if he had intended to pay to them all that God had lent him. A wiſe Prince he was queſtionleſſe; yet towards the Church ſhewed more affection; endeavouring to reduce the government in every place unto the Roman Prototype, and therein added much honour to that See, eſpecially to Pope <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> whoſe Scholler he had been. This may ſeem a ſufficient inducement to perſwade that he was the firſt patron of Engliſh Prelacy, ſeeing we finde it in no approved teſtimony before that time; nor was it long after, whenas the preſence of the Brittiſh Biſhops are found at the Synod by him called at <hi>Arles, viz.</hi> the Biſhops (not Archbiſhops) of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 42.</note> and the Biſhop of <hi>Maldune;</hi> and thoſe in no great pompe, if the relation be true, that by reaſon of their poverty they were not able to undergoe the charge of their journey and attendance, ſo as it ſeems they had but new ſet up, and had not yet found out the right way of trade that other Biſhops had attained. And thus God ordered firſt the ſetling of a Government of the Church in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and its Liberties, before the Secular part enjoyed any: therein working with this Nation as with a man, making him to be <hi>bonus homo</hi> before he can be <hi>bonus civis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Britaine</hi> thus ſet together, is wound up for motion; they ſoon learnd the uſe of Synods, from that Synod at <hi>Arles,</hi> if they had it not before; and tooke as much power to themſelves in their Synods as in other Countries was uſed, and ſomewhat more to boot. For they had the hap to continue in <hi>Britaine</hi> in free courſe a full century of yeeres before the civill Magiſtrate had any other power, but what was wrapped up under the allowance of their Roman Maſters, who like <hi>Gallio</hi> looked upon the Church affaires as out of their Spheare, and therefore cared for none of thoſe things; or if the zeale of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152542:26"/> any See far prevailed, it was much in favour of the Biſhops upon whom the Emperours began to dote as Oracles; and this raiſed the price of the Clergy, and taught them the way to fiſh for themſelves: No wonder it is therefore if Synods in <hi>Britaine,</hi> or rather the Clergy in the Synods (which probably were then the repreſentative body of the Nation) ſwayed all that was free from the Roman Magiſtracy, and in ſome things out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached their limits; eſpecially during this interim wherein the Romans held the armes of civill Magiſtracy bound and let the Clergy have their ſcope, that ſoon began to be ambient, and conceipt a new Idea of deportment, like that of the ſecond beaſt in its infancy: Nor did the Britons eſpy their danger herein, for they had been uſed to idolize their Druides; and it was no more but faces about to do as much for their Biſhops. Of this power of Synods I ſhall propound but three preſidents, and ſo draw to a concluſion of what I think meet to note con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning the Britiſh affaires. I ſuppoſe it will not be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that publique conſultations concerning the publique government of any place or Nation, ought not to be called but by the Supreame power; and that ſuch conſultations are to be directed by that Supreame power. The Britons had a King, and yet without his conſent they call a Synod againſt the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian Hereſie,<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. An. 446. Beda. Lib. 1. cap. 17.</note> and chuſe a Moderator from beyond the Sea, and by that Synod not onely overwhelmed the Hereſie, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated their King. This was a Nationall Synod, and might well ſtand with the rule of State, which then had ſeated the Supreame power in the people, as I formerly noted out of <hi>Dion.</hi> But it could be no warrant for that which followed, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Country Synod ſhould excomunicate a King, as it befell in the caſes of <hi>Moris</hi> and <hi>Morcant.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 49, 62, 382.</note> Or that ſuch a Synod ſhould intermeddle in matters of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Loumaek,</hi> who having invaded the patrimony of the Church, the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi> in a Synod of his Clergy enjoyned him penance;<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 385.</note> and the like befell unto <hi>B ockvaile,</hi> who was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Synod to make amends to <hi>Civiliack</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff</hi> for injury to him done: which I note not by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; for this exorbitancy (if ſo it were) might correſpond with theſe times wherein very probable it is that juſtice could
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152542:26"/> not be had elſewhere; and had the Clergy been as carefull of holineſſe, as in the former caſes they ſeem jealous for juſtice, <hi>Britaine</hi> muſt have had the repute of a Nation of Prieſts and holy men, rather then of Tyrants: whereas it was become a glut of wickedneſſe,<note place="margin">Gildas.</note> and a burden that God would endure no longer; which rendreth their Synod lyable to exception, as being ſuch as were either lifted up, or drawn aſide, and as the Liſt to the Cloth, ſheweth that the Nation ſtood in need of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which with a ſtrong hand God wrought into them by the ſad calamity which enſueth.</p>

The choiſe was more difficult by how much the more <hi>England</hi> was much waſted in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wars, the flower of their ſtrength ſpent in forraigne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the remainder but few, and theſe exceeding vicious; and which was worſt of all, ingaged by the Romans in a warre with the Picts, againſt whom the Romans themſelves found it too burdenſome for them to hold out, without the helpe of a wall: and albeit that the very name of an old ſervant of foure hundred yeeres continuance might have moved a Roman heart to commiſeration, yet their ſpirits faile, and forſaken <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> muſt now goe into the Wilderneſſe, and naked as they are endure the brunt of the cold ſtormes of the Northern Picts, without any ſhelter but the hidden will of God then frowning upon them.

For it had been better for them to have ſtooped to hard conditions with the Picts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152542:27"/> they were all but one people, and differing onely by the bredth of a wall, then to call in a new people whoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities they were ignorant of, and at the beſt to make them their companions, who might prove (as they afterwards did) both Lords and Maſters over them. But there is no reaſon againſt Gods will.

               <p>I hold it both needleſſe and fruitleſſe to enter into the Liſts concerning the originall of the Saxons; whither they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from the Northern parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> or the reliques of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> army under <hi>Alexander.</hi> But it ſeems their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment about the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in the generall ſo ſutable to the Graecians,<note place="margin">Suffeid.

                  <note place="margin">Albinus. Sax. 72.</note> ſaith the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.

The election of theſe Princes with their commiſſion was concluded <hi>inter majora</hi> by the generall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and they executed their commiſſion in circuits, like unto the Athenian Heliaſticke or Subdiall Court,<note place="margin">Emius.</note> which was rurall and for the moſt part kept in the open ayre; in briefe, their judicials were very ſutable to the Athenian, but their military more like the Lacedemonian, whom above all others in their manners they moſt reſembled. In their Religion they were very devout, ſaving that they much reſted in the reverence they bare to their Prieſts whom they made the moderator of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly, their Judge, advocate and executioner in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Law, therein ſubmitting to them as unto Gods inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Theſe things I note, that it may appeare
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152542:28"/> how nigh theſe invited gueſts reſemble the old Religion of the Britons,<note place="margin">Avent. Anal. Bowr 1.10.

Theſe are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments choſen by God, and called by the Britaines to be their deliverers from their enemies; which they did indeed, yet not ſwayed thereto by love of juſtice or compaſſion; for (if writers ſay true) they were no better then high-way men both by Sea and Land,<note place="margin">Amian.</note> but by their love of ſpoyle and prey and by the diſpleaſure of God againſt a diſſolute people. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe friendſhip nevertheleſſe in their firſt entrance; but eſpying the weakneſſe of the Britons and feeling the ſtrength of the Picts, and finding the Land large and good, they ſoone pickt quarrels with their Hoaſt, made peace with the Picts, and of fained friends becomming unfained foes to the Britons, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a poore remnant of Chriſtians, ſome to the furtheſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Kingdome, others into forraine Nations, like ſo many ſeedeſmen to ſow the precious ſeed of life in a ſavage ſoile. And thoſe few that remained behind profiting under much miſery, by their doctrine and good example yeelded better bleſſings unto their new come gueſts then they either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or deſired. And thus the miſeries of poore <hi>Britaine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came riches of mercy to the North and Eaſterne people; and the ruines here, the foundations of many famous Churches elſewhere. Nor yet was mercy from the Britons utterly taken away, nor their blood drawn out to the laſt drop; or their name quite blotted out of the booke of fame: for whereas two things make men miſerable, <hi>viz.</hi> the heavineſſe of the burthen without, and the failing of the heart within, and Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of redreſſe of the former beginneth in taking away the later; thus dealt he with the Britons; for in danger as want of ſtrength breeds feare, and that (by extreamity) diſpaire, ſo diſpaire oftentimes revives into a kind of rage that puts ſtrength forth beyond reaſon; I ſay beyond reaſon, for cauſe cannot be given thereof, other then Gods extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation in a judiciary way, when he ſeeth the ſtronger to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152542:28"/> wax inſolent over the weaker. Thus the Britons fled from the Picts ſo long as they had any hope of reliefe from the Saxons; but being become their enemies, and purſuing them to the low water marke, that in all reaſon they muſt either drinke or bleed their laſt; then their courage revived, and by divers victories by the ſpace of 200 yeeres God ſtopped the haſty conqueſt of the Saxons: the reſult whereof by truces, leagues, commerce, converſation, and marriages between theſe two Nations declared plainly that it was too late for the Saxons to get all, their bounds being predetermined by God, and thus declared to the world. In all which God (taming the Britons pride by the Saxons power, and diſcovering the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons darkneſſe by the Britons light) made himſelfe Lord over both peoples in the concluſion.</p>

               <p>DUring theſe troubleſome times came a third party that wrought more trouble to this Iſle then either Pict or Saxon; for it troubled all. This was the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power of the Roman Biſhop, now called the Univerſall Biſhop. For the Roman Empire having removed the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall reſidence to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> weakned the Weſterne part of the Empire, and expoſed it not onely to the forraine invaſions of the Goths, Vandals, Herules, Lombards, and other flotes of people that about theſe times by ſecret inſtinct were weary of their owne dwellings, but alſo to the riſing power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Naucler. 505.</note> and purpoſely for his advancement; Who by patience out rode the ſtormes of forraine force, and tooke advantage of thoſe publique cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous times to inſinuate deeper into the conſciences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed people, that knew no other conſolation in a plundred eſtate, but from God and the Biſhop, who was the chiefe in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152542:29"/> amongſt them; the beauty of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> thus growing in the Weſt, made him to out-reach not onely his owne Dioceſſe and Province, but to minde a kind of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Empire, and a title according thereunto; which at length he attained from an Emperour fitted for his turne: and this was enough to make him paſſe for currant in the Empire. But <hi>Britaine</hi> was forſaken by the Roman Empire above 153 yeeres before: ſo as, though the Emperour could preferre his Chaplaines power or honour as far as his owne, which was to the French ſhore: yet <hi>Britaine</hi> was in another world, under the Saxons power, and not worth loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after till the plundering was over, and the Saxon affaires ſetled, ſo as ſome fat may be had; then an inſtrument is ſought after for the worke, and none is found ſo farre fit to winde the Saxon up to the Roman bent as a Monke, that was a holy humble man in the opinion of all but of thoſe that were ſo in the truth, and knew him. This is <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſent by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to doe a worke that would not be publiquely owned; it was pretended to bring Religion to the Saxons in <hi>England;</hi> therefore they give him the title of the Saxon Apoſtle; but to be plaine, it was to bring in a Church-policy, with a kind of worſhip that rendred the <hi>Latria</hi> to God, and the <hi>Dulia</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Saxons were not wholy deſtitute of Religion; and that, <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelfe in his Letter to <hi>Brunchilda</hi> the French Queen confeſſeth: <hi>Indicamus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ad nos perveniſſe Eccleſiam Anglicanam velle fieri Chriſtianam;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Concil.

               <p>His advantages were, firſt his entrance upon <hi>Kent,</hi> the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt corner of all the Iland from the Britaines and Picts, and ſo leſſe prejudiced by their Church-policy; and at that very time intereſſed in the Roman ayre above all the other Saxons: for their King had married a daughter of <hi>France,</hi> one that was a pupill to <hi>Rome,</hi> and a devout woman;<note place="margin">Bed. hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 25.

And thus <hi>Rome</hi> may thank <hi>France</hi> for the firſt earneſt they had of all the riches of <hi>England,</hi> and we for the firſt entrance of all our enſuing bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and miſery.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Auſten</hi> had alſo a gift or trick of working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, wherein whither more ſuitable to the working of Satan or of God I cannot define. It ſeemes they walked onely in the dark; for either the Britons ſaw through them, or ſaw them not; nor could <hi>Auſten</hi> with his miracles or fineneſſe ſettle one foot-ſtep of his Church-policy amongſt them; happily they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Roman Dagon, liked the worſe of the Roman woman; and the rather becauſe the Carriage of their meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was as full of the Archbiſhop, as it was empty of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: I would not touch upon particular paſſages of action, but that its ſo remarkable that <hi>Auſten</hi> himſelfe, but a novice in compariſon of the Britiſh Biſhops (the cleareſt lights that the Northern parts of the world then had) and unto whom the right hand of fellowſhip was due by the Roman Canon,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152542:30"/> ſhould nevertheleſſe ſhew no more reſpect to them at their firſt ſolemn entrance into his preſence then to vaſſals, as I could not but note the ſame as a ſtrong argument that his whole work <hi>ab initio</hi> was but a vapour of Prelacy. This the Britiſh Biſhops ſoon eſpied, and ſhaped him an anſwer ſutable to his meſſage, the ſubſtance whereof was afterward ſent him in writing by the Abbot of <hi>Bangor;</hi> and of late publiſhed by Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BE it known (and without doubt) unto you, that we all, and every one of us are obedient and ſubject to the Church of God, and to the Pope of</hi> Rome; <hi>and to every godly Chriſtian, to love every one in his degree in perfect charity, and to helpe every one of them, by word and deed to be children of God: And other obedience then this I doe not know to be due to him whom you name to be Pope; nor by the father of fathers to be claimed or demanded. And this obedience we are ready to give and pay to him, and to every Chriſtian continually. Beſides we are under the government of the Biſhop of</hi> Caerleon <hi>upon</hi> Uske, <hi>who is to overſee under God over us, and cauſe us to keep the way ſpirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Britons reſolution, and they were as good as their word; for they maintained the liberty of their Church five hundred yeeres after this time, and were the laſt of all the Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> that gave their power to the Roman beaſt, and in the perſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth that came of that blood by <hi>Teuther,</hi> the firſt that tooke away that power againe. <hi>Auſten</hi> having met with this affront, and perceiving that the Britons were ſtronger in their faith then he by his miracles, caſt about to try the Saxons curteſie, that what the Ephod could not, the Sword wrapt up therein ſhould.<note place="margin">Bed. hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 2.

               <p>I Cannot think that the platforme of the myſtery of iniquity (when boyled to the hight) was ever foreſeen, or in the aime of the wicked ſpirits on earth, or thoſe in hell; yet were they all inſtruments of this monſtrous birth, filled with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and miſchiefe, guided principally by occaſion, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Juſtice and Wiſdome of God, to make a yoke for Monarchs, and a ſcourge to the world for their refuſall of the government of Chriſt, untill this monſter came to perfection, and wherein themſelves were <hi>feloes de ſe,</hi> and wrought their owne miſchiefe: for <hi>Auſten</hi> comming in as a third proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with King and people; and having gathered the materials of a Church, reaſon told them that a forme of government muſt be ſetled in that Church; the Saxons had no principles of their own,<note place="margin">Tacit. mor. Serm.</note> (for they had no learning) and to goe to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons for a patterne might be thought ignoble; and where the choice is ſmall its ſoone made; <hi>Rome</hi> held now the moſt part of the Churches of <hi>Europe</hi> at Schoole, the Saxons ſoon reſolve <hi>Rome</hi> that had been their mother ſhall be alſo their father: and thus at one draught they dranke up a potion of the whole Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Pope to the apparator, with a <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid imponitur &amp; imponetur,</hi> which was of ſuch laſting efficacy that it ceaſeth not to worke even to this day, although it was ſlow in the firſt provocation: For the Saxons had a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale founded in the liberty of the people; and it was a maſter-piece
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152542:31"/> for <hi>Auſten</hi> and the Clergy, ſo to worke as to remaine members of this Commonweale, and yet retaine their hearts for <hi>Rome,</hi> (which was now grown almoſt to the pitch of that Antichriſt:) for reaſon muſt needs tell them that the Saxon principles would not ſuffer them to be <hi>ad omnia</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Roman Canon allow them to be wholy Saxon; and they ſaw plainly that the times were too tender to endure them to be declarative on either part, and therefore they choſe a third way, which was to preſerve the municipall Lawes in moderation towards the Canon; and to that end to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſuch a temper upon the State as muſt admit them to be in repute, ſuch as without whom the Common-weale could not well ſubſiſt, no more then a body without a ſoule; and that few occaſions ſhould befall but at leaſt in <hi>ordine remoto</hi> muſt reflect upon both; and then all reaſon will be ſpeake them to joyne in the legiſlative power and government of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but eſpecially as Biſhops, who are now <hi>Magnae ſpes altera Romae,</hi> and the very top-flowers of wiſdome and learning. And unto this temper the Saxons were ſufficiently prepared and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable; for it was no new thing for them to admit their heatheniſh Prieſts into their generall meetings, and allow them much power therein, and then its but the perſon changed and they muſt doe as much for their Biſhops now they are become Chriſtian; eſpecially themſelves being all for the field, and overgrown with a generall ignorance, the common diſeaſe of thoſe times. Kings were in no beteer condition; it was hard for them to be baptiſed and not to be baptiſed into Rome, and commonly under ſuch a Covenant as though many might repent of, yet none durſt amend: for when as the Pope is Lord of the conſciences of the People, the Kings power may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times outface, but can never govern; the Saxon Kings were therefore faine to make a vertue of neceſſity, and advance Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be common favorites both of <hi>Rome</hi> and themſelves, to maintaine good correſpondency between both Swords; and to countenance the power of the temporall Magiſtrate in caſes of diſpute, elſe he might oftentimes command, and yet goe without. Thus enter the Prelates upon affaires of Kings and Kingdomes, and became lovers of Lordſhips, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152542:31"/> of States; and if in any thing they ſerved their Countrey, they ſerved <hi>Rome</hi> much more; their merchandiſe was made of the policies and Councels of all Kingdomes and States, and ſuch returnes proceeded as were ſtill ſubſervient to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man intereſt; and they ſo intoxicated the domeſtique coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in ſuch manner, as they generally ſtaggered, and many times came ſhort of home. Nevertheleſſe at the firſt this was but rare, clancular, and covered with much modeſty; for (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſuch choice ſpirits as <hi>Auſten</hi> had) Roman Prelacy in theſe yonger times was but Velvet-headed, and endured not much greatneſſe or bigge titles, but ſpake like a Lambe, <hi>Ego non verbis quaero proſperari ſed moribus,</hi> ſaid this <hi>Gregory</hi> to the Alexandrian Biſhop, who had put upon him the title of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Biſhop or Pope:<note place="margin">Greg.

And firſt concerning the Metropolitan. In his originall his Office was to viſite the Biſhops, admoniſh and exhort them, and in full Synod to correct ſuch diſorders as the Biſhop could not reforme, and in all things to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript Canon.<note place="margin">Concil.

               </p>
               <p>Thus witneſſeth <hi>Boniface</hi> an Archbiſhop to an Archbiſhop of an Archbiſhop; not according to the practiſe of the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was written, but according to the ancient rule. For long
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152542:32"/> before <hi>Boniface</hi> his time Archbiſhops were ſwolne beyond the girt of the Canon;<note place="margin">An. 745.</note> and before that <hi>England</hi> was honoured with that ranke of men, Metropolitans were become Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, and above all rule but that of their owne will, and through common cuſtome had no regard to any other; ſo as if <hi>England</hi> will have them, it muſt be content to have them with their faults. But the truth is, the dignity or title, which you will, was a plant of that virulent nature that would ſcarce keepe under-ground in the time of the hotteſt perſecution: for <hi>Steven</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> liked the title of univerſall Biſhop.<note place="margin">Mag. cent. 3. cap. 7.</note> And after a little peace its a wonder how it grew to that height that it had; And no leſſe wonderfull that the Saxons gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to ſuch potentates. Much of whoſe ſpirit they might have obſerved in the entrance of their firſt Archbiſhop <hi>Auſten,</hi> if God had not given them over to thraldome under that myſtery of iniquity, of ſinfull man aſpiring into the place of God, taught by that Courtly meſſenger of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſtoop to that myſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſted in the fleſh, as it was taught in ſimplicity by the rurall Picts and Britons. But this was not all, for becauſe Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops were gotten above Canon, which was thought ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, therefore they gave as large a power by Canon as the former uſurpation amounted unto, and ſo ſtretched the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to the mind of the man, whenas they ſhould have rather reduced the man to the Canon. The words of the Canon in our Engliſh tongue, runne thus: It belongs to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Biſhop to rule Gods Churches; to governe, chuſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, confirme, and remove Abbots, Abboteſſes, Presbyters, and Deacons, and herewith the King hath nothing to doe. And thus though the apparent power of Archbiſhops was great and unlimited,<note place="margin">Concil.

But the Metropolitan in <hi>England</hi> as the times then were, had yet a further advantage, even over Kings themſelves; for there were divers Kingdomes in this Iſland, and Kings had no further power then their limits afforded them: but there was but one Metropolitan for a long time in all the Saxon territories, ſo as his power was in ſpirituals over many kingdomes, and ſo he became indeed <hi>alterius orbis Papa;</hi> and it was a remarkable teſtimony of Gods ſpeciall providence that the ſpirits of theſe petty Popes ſhould be ſo bound up under the notion of the infallibility of the Roman chaire; that they had not torne the European Church into as many Popedomes as Provinces. But no doubt God ordered it for a ſcourge to the world, that Antichriſt ſhould be but one, that he might be the more abſolute tyrant, and that Kings ſhould bow down their necks under the double or rather multiple yoke of Pope and Archbiſhops, for their rebellion againſt the King of Kings.</p>

               <p>HAd not Biſhops been ſomewhat ſutable, the Roman Clergy had not been like it ſelfe; and it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Auſtins</hi> principles to have advanced to Biſhopricks men better qualified then himſelfe. They firſt ruled the Saxon Church joyntly in the nature of a Presbytery till about ſixty yeeres after <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, their pride would not endure toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any longer; and it may be grew ſomewhat untractable under the Metropolitan, that reſolved to be prouder then all; and thereupon <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> firſt divided his Province into five Dioceſſes,<note place="margin">Ant. Brit. 52. Concil. Brit. 133. Ant. Brit. 54, Ibid. 53.</note> and by appointment of them Kings and people placed Biſhops over each, every one of them being of the right Roman ſtampe, as himſelfe was of the right Roman ſhaving. And it had been a wonder if Epiſcopacy now
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152542:33"/> for the ſpace of three hundred yeeres degenerated, and that into ſuch a monſtrous ſhape as a Pope ſhould by tranſplanting become regenerate into their originall condition of meekneſſe and humility. But its much greater wonder that they ſhould become ſo purely ambicious as not to endure a thought of the waies of ſobriety, but would be proud by Law; to let all the world know that they held it no infirmity but an honour. For albeit that in the firſt time the Biſhops work was to inſtruct and teach, to ſee the ſervice of God to be diligently and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſtred in publique congregations,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 238, 246, 261.</note> to exhort, reprove, and by teaching to amend ſuch matters as he ſhould finde in life and doctrine contrary to Religion: and accordingly they carried themſelves meekly and humbly,<note place="margin">Mag.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of Church-mens maintenance amongſt the Saxons.</head>
               <p>I Take no notice in this account of the Abbats and Priors, &amp; other ſuch religious men, as they were then called; nor can I paſſe them amongſt the number of Church-governours or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, being no other then as a ſixt finger, or an excreſcence that the body might well ſpare, and yet they ſucked up much of the blood and ſpirits thereof. But as touching the maintenance of thoſe formerly mentioned, who had a conſtant influence in the government of the affaires of the publique worſhip of God, and regard of the ſalvation of the ſoules of the people; I ſay their maintenance was diverſly raiſed, and as diverſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: Firſt, through the bounty of Kings and great men, Lands and Mannors were beſtowed upon the Metropolitan and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in free almes; and from theſe aroſe the maintenance that aſcended up in abundance to the higher Region of the Clergy, but came againe in thinne dewes ſcarce enough to keep the husbandmans hope from diſpaire; otherwiſe had not the Prelates ſo ſoon mounted up into the chaire of pompe and ſtate, as they did. I ſay, theſe are given in free almes, or more plainly, as almes free from all ſervice: and this was doubtleſſe ſoon thought upon (for it was formerly in preſident with their heatheniſh Prieſts and Druids; as <hi>Caeſar</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Com. 6.</note> that they had <hi>omninm rerum immunitatem:</hi>) yet with the exception of works of publique charity and ſafety, ſuch as are maintaining of high waies, repairing of bridges, and fortifying of Caſtles, &amp;c. and hereof the preſidents are numerous. The worke whereto this wages was appointed was the worſhip of God, and increaſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152542:35"/> of Religion; and thus not onely many of the Kings Subjects were exempted from publique ſervice, but much of the Revenue of the Kingdome formerly imployed for the publique ſafety became acquitted from the ſervice of the field, to the ſervice of the beade; the ſtrength of the Kingdome much impaired, and the ſubjects much grieved; who in thoſe early times ſaw the inconveniences,<note place="margin">M. Paris in vit. Eadrick. Abb.</note> and complained thereof to their Kings, but could not prevaile. This was the vintage of Kings and great men, but the gleanings of the people were much more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull; (for beſides the Courts which ſwelled as the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe times increaſed, and thereby enriched the cofers of that covetous generation,<note place="margin">An. 1009.

The moſt ancient of all the reſt was the Firſt-fruits,<note place="margin">Firſt-fruits.</note> which was by way of eminency called <hi>Cyrick-ſceate,</hi> or in more plaine Engliſh, Church-fee; which was alwaies payable upon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

The Biſhop at the firſt was the generall receiver as well of theſe as of the former, and by him they were divided into three parts, and imployed one to the poore; another for the maintenance of the Church;<note place="margin">Concil.

But in future times many acts of ſtate ſucceeded concerning this,<note place="margin">Ingulſus.</note> amongſt which that grant of <hi>Athelwolfe</hi> muſt be a little pauſed upon. Some writers ſay that he gave the tenth manſion,<note place="margin">Geſt. pontif. Lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> and the tenth of all his goods: but <hi>Malmsbury</hi> ſaith, the tenth of the hides of Land;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152542:35"/> but in the donation it ſelfe, as its by him recited, its the tenth manſion. But <hi>Math.

The forme of the Donation it ſelfe is uncertaine and varions, the inference or relation more uncertaine, and unadviſed; for if the King had granted that which was not his owne, it could neither be accounted pious or rationall. Nor doe we finde in the donation that the King in preciſe words gave the Land, or the tenth part of the Land of his Kingdome; but the tenth of his Land in the Kingdome: and the exemplification publiſhed by <hi>Math. Weſtm.</hi> countenanceth the ſame, albeit the Hiſtorian obſerved it not; but ſuppoſe that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome joyned with the King in the conceſſion, and that it was the courſe to paſſe it onely in the Kings name, yet could not the tenth Hide, tenth Manſion, or tenth part of the Kingdome be granted without confuſion in the poſſeſſions of the people; for either ſome particular perſons muſt part with all their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, or elſe out of every mans poſſeſſion muſt have iſſued a proportionable ſupply, or laſtly a tenth part of every mans poſſeſſion, or houſe and land, muſt be ſet forth from the reſt: or ſome muſt loſe all and become beggars, to ſave others: all which are to me equally improbable. Nevertheleſſe I doe not take the thing to be wholy fabulous, but may rather ſuppoſe that either a tenth was given out of the Kings own Demeſnes, which is moſt probable; or elſe the tenth of the profits of the Lands throughout the Kingdome; and that it was by publique act of ſtate, and that clauſe forgotten by Hiſtorians.<note place="margin">Concil.

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:152542:36"/> confirmed that Donation out of ſuch Tenements as had thirty pence <hi>vivae pecuniae.</hi> If then it be granted that the Saxon ſubjects had any property in their Lands or tenements, as no man ever queſtioned, then could not this charge be impoſed without the publique conſent of the people; and then the aſſertions of <hi>Polidore</hi> and the Monks, who tell us that <hi>Ina</hi> and <hi>Offa</hi> had made the whole kingdome tributary to <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt needs be a miſtake, both in the perſon, and the nature of the gift, ſeeing there is a much more difference between an Almes and a Tribute then between the King and the people.

               <p>Secondly, that it was an Almes onely from the King, and out of his own Demeſnes, may ſeem not improbable, becauſe it was <hi>ex regali munificentia,</hi> which could never be affirmed if the gift had been out of the eſtates of others. Secondly, it was granted onely out of ſuch houſes as yeelded thirty pence rent, called <hi>vivae pecuniae,</hi> becauſe in thoſe times rent was payd in Victuall; ſo as it may ſeem that onely Farmes were charged herewith: and not all mens Farmes neither; for the generall income will never anſwer that proportion.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the manner of the Prelates government of the Saxon Church.</head>
               <p>HAving diſcourſed of the perſons and precincts, it now befals to touch upon the manner of the government of the Church by the Saxon Prelates; which was not wrapped up in the narrow cloſet of private opinion, but ſtated and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by publique Councell, as well in the making as execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of lawes already made; This courſe was learned from Antiquity,<note place="margin">Malmesb. geſt. pontif. lib. 3. fo. 263.</note> and inforced upon them by a Roman conſtitution, in the caſe that concerned Archbiſhop <hi>Theodore</hi> and <hi>Wilfrid</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:152542:38"/> upon this ground, <hi>Quod enim multorum concilio geritur nulli con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentientium ingerat ſcandalum.</hi> Theſe are moſt ordinarily called Synods, although at the pleaſure of the Relator called alſo Councels, and are either Dioceſſan or Provinciall, or Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and theſe either particular or generall.<note place="margin">Baronus An. 930.</note> The generall conſiſted of all the Biſhops and Clergy; and ſuch was the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod under Archbiſhop <hi>Dunſtan</hi> called. The Nationall Synods were diverſly called; ſometimes by the Pope, ſometimes by the King, as the firſt moving occaſion concerned either of them. For Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> in a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> ordered that a Synod ſhould be called in <hi>Saxony</hi> (viz <hi>England) Sacroſancta authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; noſtra Synodali unitate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malmesb. geſt. pontif. lib. 3. p 163. An. 680.</note> and many Legatine Synods in ſucceeding times demonſtrate the ſame. That the Saxon Kings alſo called them upon occaſion, is obvious through all the Councels, and needleſſe to inſtance amongſt ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. The Provinciall Synods were ſometimes convocated by the King, and ſometimes by the Archbiſhop,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 191, 310, &amp; 318.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times joyntly. The Dioceſſan were called by the Biſhop. In the Nationall and Provinciall ſometimes Kings moderated alone, ſometimes the Archbiſhop alone, and ſometimes they joyned together.<note place="margin">Ibid. 316, 318, 387.</note> The Aſſiſtants were others both of the Clergy and Laity, of ſeverall ranks or degrees; and it ſeemeth that women were not wholly excluded; for in a Synod under <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> Abbatiſſes were preſent and atteſted the acts of that Synod, together with others of the Clergy of greater degree. The matters in action were either the making or executing of Laws for government; and becauſe few Lawes paſſed that did not ſome way reflect upon the King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as the Clergy, the King was for the moſt part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and alwaies the Lords, and others: Yet if the matters concerned the Church in the firſt act, the King though preſent, the Archbiſhop was nevertheleſſe preſident;<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 245, 327, 387.</note> as it befell at a Synod at <hi>Cleverſhoe, An.</hi> 747. and another at <hi>Celchith, An.</hi> 816. And in the reigne of <hi>Edward</hi> the elder, though the Synod was called by the King, yet the Archbiſhop was preſident. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all which it may be in the ſumme well conceived, that the penning of the Councels aforeſaid, either the Clergy (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pen-men) were partiall or negligent in the ſetting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152542:39"/> down of the right form; and that the Kings called theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies by inſtance of the Archbiſhop, and ſometime preſided in his owne perſon, and ſometimes deputed the Archbiſhop thereto.</p>
               <p>The executing of Lawes was for the moſt part left to the Dioceſan Synods; yet when the caſes concerned great men, the more generall Councels had the cogniſance, and therein proceeded ſtrictly ſparing no perſons of what degree ſoever; Examples we finde hereof,<note place="margin">M Weſtm. An. 955, 958. Concil. Brit. 479.</note> amongſt others, of one inceſtuous Lord, and two delinquent Kings, <hi>Edwy</hi> and <hi>Edgar.</hi> Nay they ſpared not the whole Kingdome; for in the quarrell between <hi>Cenulphus</hi> the King and Archbiſhop <hi>Wilfrid</hi> the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was under interdict for ſix yeeres ſpace; and no Baptiſme adminiſtred all that time.<note place="margin">Ibid. 332.</note> Nor were they very nice in med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with matters beyond their Sphere, even with matters of property; for at a provinciall Councell (for ſo its called) they bore all down before them, even the King himſelfe, as in the caſe between <hi>Cenulphus</hi> the King and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> concerning the Monaſtery of <hi>Cotham.</hi>

Theſe Synods were to be holden twice every yeere, at certaine times; and if they met with any matter too hard for them to reforme, they referred it to the Provinciall or Nationall Synod.</p>

               <p>AS the power of Synods grew by degrees, ſo did alſo their worke; both which did mutually breed and feed each other:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hereſie.</hi> An. 446.</note> Their worke conſiſted in the reforming and ſetling matters of doctrine, and practice. The firſt was the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and which firſt occaſioned the uſe of Synods. In this Iſland the Pelagian Hereſie brought in the firſt preſident of Synods that we have extant; and herein it will admit of no deniall, but in the infancy of the Church the teachers are the principall Judges of the nature of errour and hereſie, as alſo of the truth; as the Church is the beſt guide to every Chriſtian in his firſt inſtruction in the principles; but after ſome growth there is that in every Church and Chriſtian that makes it ſelfe party in judging of truth and errour joyntly with the firſt teachers. And therefore its not without reaſon that in that firſt Synod although <hi>Germanus</hi> was called <hi>Judex,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beda. hiſt. l. 1.</note> yet the people hath the name of <hi>Arbiter,</hi> and tis ſaid that they did <hi>conteſtare ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium.</hi>

               <p>Blaſphemy<note place="margin">Blaſphemy.</note> was queſtionleſſe under Church-cenſure, but I finde no footſteps of any particular Law againſt it: yet in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Law was made to puniſh it with cutting out the tongue of the delinquent:<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 341.

               <p>But Apoſtacy was an early ſinne, and ſoon provided againſt;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> An. 314. Concil. Brit. 41.

               <p>The times anciently were not ſo zealous for due obſervance of Divine worſhip,<note place="margin">Falſe worſhip.</note> unleſſe by the Churchmen who were the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152542:40"/> therein;<note place="margin">Canon. Apoſt. cap. 10.</note> a forraine Canon was made to enforce that duty long before; but it would not down with the rude Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they, or the greater ſort of them were content to come to Church onely to pray and heare the word, and ſo went away; this is noted by that ancient writer in nature of an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Bed hiſt. lib. 3. cap. 26.</note> as if ſomewhat elſe was to be done which they neglected; this ſomewhat was the maſſe which in thoſe daies was wont to be acted after the Sermon ended:<note place="margin">Mag. Cent. 7. cap. 6.</note> and its probable that if the Nobles were ſo ill trained up, the inferiour ſort was worſe; and yet finde we no law to conſtraine their diligence: or to ſpeake more plainly, its very likely the Saxons were ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in their worſhip as there was either little need of Law to retaine them,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 306.</note> or little uſe of Law to reclaime them; for its obſerved in their late Pſalter that the Roman Clergy was not more forward to Image or Saint-worſhip, then the people were backward thereto; and therein ſhewed themſelves the true ſeed of their anceſtors in <hi>Germany,</hi> of whom its obſerved that they indured not Images,<note place="margin">Tacit.

               </p>
               <p>Sorcery and Witchcraft they had in abomination: yet it was a ſinne alwaies in a myſt, and hard to be diſcerned but by the quickſighted Clergy; and therefore it was left to their cenſure,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 246. An. 745.</note> as a ſinne againſt the worſhip of God. This <hi>Ethebald</hi> the Mercian King firſt endowed them with; and they alone exerciſed the cogniſance thereof till <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, who inflicted thereupon the penalty of baniſhment:<note place="margin">Ibid. 377.</note> but if any were killed by inchantment, the delinquent ſuffered death by a Law made by <hi>Aethelſtan.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. 403. An. 928.</note> And thus by degrees became one and the ſame crime puniſhable in ſeverall juriſdictions in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reſpects.</p>
               <p>Concerning perjury,<note place="margin">Perjury.</note> the Prelates had much to doe therewith in future times, and they had the firſt hint from <hi>Ina</hi> the Saxon Kings grant to them of power to take teſtimonies upon oath;<note place="margin">Ll.

But no poſitive Law allowed them that power of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152542:40"/> ſentence till <hi>Aethelſtans</hi> law gave it,<note place="margin">An. 928.</note> and upon conviction by the ſame Law diſteſted the delinquents oath for ever.</p>
               <p>Sacriledge<note place="margin">Sacriledge.</note> comes in the next place, being a particular crime meerly of the Clergy mens exemption and naming; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they baptiſed it, you might have well enough called it theft, oppreſſion, or extortion. This crime the Prelates held under their cogniſance by vertue of that generall maxime,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 127. An. 610. Ibid. 265.</note> that all wrong done to the Church muſt be judged by the Church. The firſt time that I can obſerve they challenged this power, was by <hi>Egbert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> in the ſeventh Century.</p>
               <p>But nothing was more their own then Simony;<note place="margin">Simony.</note> and that may be the reaſon why we finde ſo little thereof either for the diſcovery or correcting thereof. All former crimes were in their firſt act deſtructive to the Church, but this advantagious;<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 263.</note> and therefore though the Canons roare loud, yet the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not mortall, becauſe its bent againſt the dignity, and not the gaine; and although the Canon would not that any Presbyter ſhould be made, but preſented therewith to ſome place to exerciſe his function in, yet it ſerveth not for thoſe times when men were ſent forth rather to make flocks, then to feed flocks.</p>
               <p>And yet the theame of marriage was the beſt diſh in all their entertainment:<note place="margin">Matrimonial cauſes.</note> they had the whole common place thereof with the appurtenances within the compaſſe of their text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever it attained the honour of a Sacrament. It was a branch of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, whereof they were the ſole expoſitours, and ſo ſeemeth to be caſt upon them by a kind of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as an orphan that had no owner. Nevertheleſſe a paſſage in <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſeemeth to repoſe this truſt in the civill Magiſtrate: for he relateth out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> concerning a divorce ſued out by a godly Matron long before the Prelacy got into the ſaddle, or the Clergy had the power of Judicature: And whereas <hi>Lucius</hi> taxed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbicius</hi> the Magiſtrate for puniſhing <hi>Ptolomy</hi> who was guilty of no crime worthy of his cogniſance in that kind; amongſt other crimes enumerated by him, whereof <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was not guilty, he nameth the crimes againſt the ſeventh Commandement, intimating thereby a power in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152542:41"/> the Judge to have cogniſance of thoſe crimes as well as others. But the Prelacy beginning to mount, nibled at it in the ſecond Century, but more clearly in the fourth, when the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were allayed, and men of learning began to feele their honour; and never left purſuit till they had ſwallowed the baite, and exerciſed not onely a judiciary power in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all doubts and controverſies concerning the ſame; but challenged an efficienciary power in the marriage-making. This garland <hi>Auſtin</hi> brought over with him, and crowned the Saxon Clergy therewith,<note place="margin">Beda. hiſt. l. 1. cap. 27.</note> as may appeare by his Queres to Pope <hi>Gregory;</hi> and thus the Saxons that formerly wedded themſelves, became hereafter wedded by the Clergy; yet the civill Magiſtrate retained a ſupreame legiſlative power concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, as the joynt marriages between the Saxons, Britons, and Picts doe manifeſt; for its ſaid of that work, that it was effected <hi>per commune concilium &amp; aſſenſum omnium Epiſcoporum, procerum, comitum &amp; omnium ſapientum ſeniorum &amp; populorum totius regni &amp; per praeceptum Regis Inae,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> their King were enacted Laws or rules concerning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 219. Concil. Brit. p. 427. An. 944.</note> and ſo unto the Lay power was the Eccleſiaſticall adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this work.</p>
               <p>The Clergy having gained the principall, with more eaſe obtained the appurtenances; ſuch as are Baſtardy, Adultery, Fornication, and Inceſt. There was ſome doubt concerning Baſtardy,<note place="margin">Baſtardy.</note> becauſe it trenched farre into the title of inheritance, and ſo they attained that <hi>ſub modo,</hi> as afterward will appeare. The Lawes of <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the elder allowed them the cogiſance of Inceſt;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inceſt.</hi> Concil. Brit. p. 392. An. 905.</note> although nevertheleſſe the civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate retained alſo the cogniſance thereof, ſo far as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the penalty of the temporall Law. Adultery and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation they held without controle, yet in the ſame manner as the former;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adultery. Fornication.</hi> Concil. Brit. p. 558.</note> for the civill Magiſtrate had cogniſance thereof, ſo far as touched the temporall penalty: And to give them as much as can be allowed, its probable that in all or moſt of the caſes foregoing they had the honour to adviſe in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the crime, and declaring the Law, or defining the matter; for in thoſe ignorant times it could not be expected from any other.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:152542:41"/>
               <p>But how the cogniſance of Tythes crept under their wing,<note place="margin">Tythes.</note> might be much more wondred at, for that it was originally from the grant of the people; nor can a better ground be found by me then this, that it was a matter of late originall; for till the ſeventh Century the times were troubleſome, and no ſetled maintenance could be expected for the Miniſtry, where men were not in ſome certainty of their daily bread. And as it will hardly be demonſtrated that this title was ever in any poſitive Nationall Law before the time of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> in whoſe time by a Synod of Clergy and Laity it was decreed that Tythes ſhould be gathered by ſelected perſons, to pay the Biſhops and Presbyters:<note place="margin">Synod Durien. cap. 7. An. 785. Rabban. epiſt. ad Hadubrand.</note> So neither can I finde any Saxon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall conſtitution to ſettle this duty, till <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church men had them as a voluntary gift (ſo far as touched the <hi>quota pars</hi>) for the ſpace of well nigh a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres before. But <hi>Alfred</hi> made a Nationall Law under a penalty to inforce this duty,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 377</note> which the Canon could not wring from the Saxons, how dreadfull ſoever the cenſure proved. And by this meanes the Church had their remedy by Eccleſiaſticall cenſure for the matter in fact, and alſo the civill Magiſtrate the cogniſance in point of right, albeit future times introduced a change herein.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> A briefe Cenſure of the Saxon Prelaticall Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
               <p>THis that I have ſaid might at the firſt view ſeem to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a curious ſtructure of Church policy, which might have put a period to time it ſelfe; but (to ſpeak <hi>ſine ira &amp; ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi>) the height was too great, conſidering the foundation, and therefore ever weake, and in need of props. The foundation was neither on the rocke, nor on good ground, but by a ginne ſcrewed to the Roman Conſiſtory, or like a Caſtle in the ayre hanging upon a pin of favour of Kings and great men. At the firſt they thought beſt to temporiſe, and to hold both theſe their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152542:42"/> ſtrings to their bow: but feeling themſelves ſomewhat under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped by the conſciences of the ignorant people, they ſoon grew wondrous brave, even to the jealouſie of Princes; which alſo was known ſo notoriouſly, that the publique Synods rang that the Prelates loved not Princes,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 254. An. 747.</note> but emulated them, and envied their greatneſſe, and purſued them with detraction. And if the Cloth may be judged by the Liſt, that one example of <hi>Wilfrid</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> will ſpeake much. He was once ſo humble minded as he would alwaies goe on foot to preach the Word;<note place="margin">Malmesb. geſt. pontif. lib. 3. An. 680.</note> but by that time he was warme in his Archbiſhops Robes, he was ſerved in Veſſels of Gold and Silver, and with Troops of followers, in ſuch gallantry as his pompe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied of the Queen. A ſtrange growth of Prelacy in ſo ſmall a ſpace as eighty yeeres, and in the middeſt of ſtormy times, ſuch as then afflicted this poore Countrey: But this is not all, for never doth pride lead the way, but ſome other baſe vice fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. I wil not mention the lives of the Monks, Nuns, and other Clerks;<note place="margin">Boniface epiſt. ad Cutbertum. An. 745.</note> 
                  <hi>Malmsbury</hi> ſpeaks ſufficiently of their luxury, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, quarrelling and fighting: Others witneſſe thereto, and tell us that the Clergy ſeldome read the Scripture, and did never preach; and were ſo groſſely ignorant, that <hi>Alfred</hi> the King being a diligent tranſlator of Latine Writers into the Saxon tongue, rendreth this reaſon, becauſe they would be very uſefull to ſome of his Biſhops that underſtood not the Latine tongue.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 379.</note> Nor were the Presbyters of another die; for that King bewailing their ignorance, in his Letter to <hi>Wolfegus,</hi> ſaith, that thoſe which were <hi>de gradu ſpirituali</hi> were come to that condition that few of them on this ſide <hi>Humber</hi> could underſtand their common prayers, or tranſlate them into Saxon; and ſo few, as I doe not (ſaith he) rememember one on this ſide the Thames when I began to reigne. And the Synod that ſhould have ſalved all, covers the ſore with this Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call playſter, that thoſe of the Clergy that could not ſay <hi>Domine miſerere</hi> in Latine,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 248. &amp; 253. An. 747.</note> ſhould inſtead thereof ſay <hi>Lord have mercy upon us</hi> in Engliſh. It was therefore a vaine thing for the Clergy to reſt upon their works, or title of Divine right; Their great pompe, ſacred places, and favour of Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them to the admiration, or rather adoration of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152542:42"/> people, and the favour of the Roman chaire unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Kings; who maintained their intereſt with the Conclave on the one ſide, and with the people on the other ſide by their means; and ſo they mutually ſerved one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It cannot be denied but the Pope and Kings were good Cards in thoſe daies; yet had the Prelacy maturely conſidered the nature of the Saxon government, ſo much depending upon the people, they might have laid a more ſure foundation and attained their ends with much more eaſe and honour. I commend nor the baſe way of popularity by principles of flattery; but that honourable ſervice of truth and vertue which ſets up a Throne in the minds of the vulgar, few of whom but have ſome ſparks of nature left unquenched; for though reſpect may chance to meet with greatneſſe, yet reverence is the proper debt to goodneſſe, without which we looke at great men as Comets whoſe influence works miſchiefe, and whoſe light ſerves rather to be gazed upon, then for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>The foundation thus unhappily laid, the progreſſe of the building was no leſſe irregular in regard of their ends that they aimed at: For firſt, they admitted the Laity into their Synods; who were not ſo dull but could eſpie their ambition, nor ſo baſe ſpirited as to live in ſlavery after conviction: This errour was eſpied I confeſſe, but it was too late; and though they reformed it, yet it was after foure hundred yeeres labour, and in the meane time by the contentions of the Clergy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, Kings had firſt learned ſo much of their Supremacy, and the Laity ſo much of their liberty, as they began to plead with the Clergy, and had brought the matter to iſſue, before the Synod could rid themſelves of theſe Lay Spectators, or rather overſeers of their waies and actions. A ſecond errour, was the yoking of the Biſhops power under that of the Synods. For they had little or no power by the Canon that was not under their controle, neither in admiſſion or deprivation of Presbyters or others, determining of any cauſe,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 260, 263.</note> nor paſſing ſentence of excommunication: and this could not but much hinder the haſty growth of Antichriſts power in this Kingdome; nor could it ever be compleated ſo long as the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152542:43"/> Synods had the chiefe power. Nevertheleſſe the inthralled ſpirits of the Clergy, and terror of the Papall thunderbolt, in continuance of time ſurmounted this difficulty, and Synods became ſo tame and eaſily led, as if there had been but one Divell to rule amongſt them all. For if any quick eye, or active ſpirit did but begin to peep or ſtir, the Legate <hi>e latere</hi> ſoon reduced him into ranke, and kept all in awe with a <hi>ſub poena</hi> of unknown danger. A third errour, was the allowing of peculiars and exemptions of Religious Houſes from ordinary juriſdiction; and this was an errour in the firſt concoction, a block in the way of Prelacy, and a clogge to keepe it down. This errour was ſoon felt, and was occaſion of much mutiny in the body Eccleſiaſticall: but exceeding profitable for <hi>Rome,</hi> not onely in point of Revenue by the multitude of appeales, but eſpecially in maintaining a party for the Roman See, in caſe the Prelacy of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſtumble at the Supremacy of <hi>Rome.</hi> Otherwiſe it ſeemed like a wenne upon the body, rather then any homogene member, and without which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Engliſh Prelacy had thriven much better, and the Roman chaire much worſe. In all which regards I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Prelaticall government in <hi>England</hi> was as yet like a young Bear not fully licked, but left to be made compleat by time and obſervation.</p>

               <p>HAving already treated of the Saxon Church, in order I am now come to the Republique, which in all probability will be expected to be ſuitable to their originall in <hi>Germany,</hi> whereunto having relation, I ſhall firſt fall upon the perſons and degrees abſtractively, then in their aſſemblies, and laſtly of their Laws and cuſtomes. The Saxons in their firſt ſtate in <hi>Germany</hi> were diſtributed into foure claſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nobles, the free-men, the manumitted perſons, and the bond-men.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152542:43"/> Under the Nobility, and from them, aroſe one that was called a King, of whom I ſhall ſpeake a part: the two laſt differed onely in the bare liberty of their perſons, and therefore may be comprehended under one head, as they were in their originall.</p>
               <p>A King amongſt the Saxons in probability was anciently a Commander in the field, an Officer <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary member in the conſtitution of their ſtate; for in time of peace, when the Common-wealth was it ſelfe, the executive power of the Law reſted much in the Nobility: but in times of warre, and in publique diſtractions they choſe a Generall, and all ſware obedience unto him during the war;<note place="margin">Witikum. geſt. Saxon. lib. 1.</note> it being finiſhed, the Generall laid down his command, and every one lived <hi>aequo jure propria contentus poteſtate.</hi> But in their tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration into <hi>Britaine,</hi> the continuance of the war cauſing the continuall uſe of the General, made that Place or Office to ſettle and ſwell into the condition of a King; and ſo he that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Dux</hi> became <hi>Rex,</hi> there being no more difference in the nature of their places then in the ſence of the words, the one ſignifying to lead, the other to governe; ſo as he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was a ſervant for the occaſion, afterwards became a ſervant for life, yet clothed with Majeſty, like ſome bitter Pill covered with Gold, to make the ſervice better taſted. Nor was the place more deſirable, if duly conſidered. For firſt, his Title reſted upon the good opinion of the Free-men; and it ſeemeth to be one of the beſt Gems of the Crown, for that he was thereby declared to be moſt worthy of the love and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the people. Yet was the ground of their election ſo uncertaine, as a man might imagine that ſometimes there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more of the will then of the judgement in it; that it might be ſaid to be the more free; for they neither excluded wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nor children further then preſent occaſions lead them. The Weſt-Saxons depoſed <hi>Seburg</hi> their Queen becauſe they would not fight under a woman;<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. An. 672. M. Weſtm. An. 912, 919. Tacit.

A cuſtome it was ſo much the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152542:44"/> more honourable, by how much it demonſtrateth freedome, and that the worth of the people reſted not ſo much in the head, as its diffuſed through the whole body. And it ſeemeth to runne in the blood of an Engliſh man, even to this day, to be as brave under a ſingle Queen, as under the moſt valiant King, if not much more: and ſtill to ſtrive to be as famous for the defence of Majeſty whereever they ſet it, as the Britons were of old: Nor were they different in their reſpect of age from that of the ſex; for though after the death of <hi>Edmond, Edwin</hi> or <hi>Edgar</hi> were to have ſucceeded in the Crown by the right of deſcent, yet the States would not admit them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were minors; but the Mercians admitted <hi>Kenelme</hi> a child of ſeven yeeres old to be their King.

An. 747.</note> and confirmed by great <hi>Offa:</hi> The rule of their election was the ſame with that in <hi>Germany,</hi> viz. to elect the chiefeſt out of the chiefeſt family, that is,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> the chiefeſt for worth, not by deſcent; yet the honour they bare to their brave Kings who had deſerved well, made ſome to honour their poſterity, and to chuſe their eldeſt after their deceaſe, and ſo in time Crownes were taken up by Cuſtome, and election often times ſubſequent was accounted but a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, unleſſe the people will diſpute the point.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this election was qualified under a ſtipulation or covenant, wherein both Prince and people were mutually bound each to other; the people to defend their King, which the Hiſtorian ſaith was <hi>praecipuum Sacramentum;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and the Prince to the people to be no other then the influence of the Law ſutable to that ſaying of <hi>Aethelſtan</hi> the Saxon King,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p 397.</note> ſeeing I according to your Law allow you what is yours, doe you ſo with me; as if the Law were the ſole umpire between King and people, and unto which not onely the people, but alſo the King muſt ſubmit. The like whereunto <hi>Ina</hi> the great Saxon King alſo,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae. Lamb.</note> No great man, ſaith he, nor any other in the whole
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152542:44"/> Kingdome may aboliſh the written Laws. Kings furthermore bound themſelves (at their entrance into the Throne) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by an oath; as its noted of <hi>Canutus,</hi> unto whom after <hi>Aetheldred</hi> was dead, the Biſhops, Abbats, Dukes,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 1. ſect. 2.</note> and other Nobles came and elected him to be their King, and ſware fealty unto him; and he againe ſware to them that <hi>Secundum Deum &amp; ſecundum ſeculum &amp;c.</hi> viz. according to the Lawes of God and of the Nation he would be a faithfull Lord to them.<note place="margin">Wigortn. An. 1016.</note> Its probable I grant that the <hi>praecipuum Sacramentum</hi> formerly mentioned was in the firſt nature more perſonall for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the perſon of their leader whiles he was their Captain becauſe it much concerned the good of the Army, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom all muſt ſcatter, and bring all to ruine; and this the words of the Hiſtorian doe evidence. But the ſafety of the whole people depended not on him after the warre was done, and therefore the oath tied them not any further; nor did the ſafety of the people afterwards, when as the Saxons entred this Land ſo abſolutely reſt upon the perſon of the King, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he proved unfit to mannage the worke: and therefore the fealty that the people ſware to their King, was not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely determined upon their perſons, otherwiſe then in order to the publique weale, as may appeare from the Lawes of the Confeſſor, who was within thirty yeeres after the reigne of <hi>Aethelſtan,</hi> formerly mentioned; The words in Engliſh run thus: <q rend="inline">All the people in their Folkmote ſhall confederate themſelves as ſworn bretheren, to defend the Kingdome againſt ſtrangers and enemies, together with their Lord the King, and to preſerve his Lands and Honours together with him with all faithfulneſſe, and that within and without the Kingdom of <hi>Britaine</hi> they will be faithfull to him as to their Lord and King.</q> So as tis evident the Saxons fealty to their King was ſubſervient to the publique ſafty, and the publique ſafety is neceſſarily dependant upon the liberty of the Lawes. Nor was it to be expected that the Saxons would endure a King above this pitch. For thoſe parts of <hi>Germany</hi> (whence they came) that had the Regiment of Kings (which theſe had not) yet uſed they their Kings in no other manner then as ſervants of State in ſending them as Embaſſadours and Captaines,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152542:45"/> if they claimed more intereſt in him then he in them: and the Hiſtorian ſaith expreſly, that amongſt thoſe people in <hi>Germany</hi> that had Kings, their Kings had a defined power, and were not <hi>ſupra libertatem.</hi> And this maxime of State became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards priviledged by Sanctuary: for by the growth of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, not only the Clergy, but even their tenants and retainers were exempt from reach of Kings, even by their own conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion allowed of a Law that cut the throat of their indefined prerogative,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Ed. cap. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That if the King defend not his people, and eſpecially Church-men from injury, <hi>nec nomen Regis in eo conſtabit, verum nomen Regis perdit.</hi> Which Law however it might paſſe for currant Divinity in thoſe daies, yet its ſtrange it ſhould get into a publique act of State. Nor was this a dead word,<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. An. 756, 758. Wigorn. An. 755.</note> for the people had formerly a tricke of depoſing their Kings (when they ſaw him peep above the ordinary reach) and this was an eaſie work for them to doe, where ever neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes of their own Nation watched for the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals of Crowns: This made the Monarchicall Crown in this Land to walke circuit into all parts of the Countrey to finde heads fit to weare it ſelfe untill the Norman times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Saxons had ſo hammered their Kings in their elections, and made him ſo properly their own, as they clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an intereſt not onely in the perſon of their Kings, but alſo in their eſtates, ſo as in ſome reſpects they were ſcarcely <hi>ſui juris.</hi> For King <hi>Baldred</hi> had given the Mannor of <hi>Malings</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> to <hi>Chriſtchurch</hi> in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and becauſe the Lords conſented not thereto,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 340.</note> it was revoked, and King <hi>Egbert</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made a new grant by advice of the Lords; which ſhewes that the Demeſnes of the Crown were holden ſacred, and not to be diſpoſed of to any other uſe, though pious, without the conſent of the Lords: and herewith concurre all the Saxon infeodations, atteſted and confirmed by Biſhops, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, Dukes, and others of the Nobility under their ſeverall hands.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe Kings were not then like unto plumed Eagles, expoſed to the charity of the Foules for food, but had a royall maintenance ſuitable to their Majeſty; their power was dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, one as a Captaine, other as a King; the firſt was firſt, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152542:45"/> made way for the ſecond; as Captaine, their power was to lead the army, puniſh according to demerits, and according to laws; and reward according to diſcretion. As Captaine, they had by ancient cuſtome the whole ſpoile left to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering by permiſſion of the army,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Exigunt Principis liberalitate illum Bellatorem equum, illam cruentam &amp; victricem frameam:</hi> and they were not wont in ſuch caſes to be cloſe handed <hi>(per bella raptus munificentiae materia)</hi> the ſpoiles in theſe waſted parts of <hi>Germany</hi> bring little other then horſes and armes. But after they came into <hi>Britaine,</hi> the change of ſoile made them more fat; Horſes and Armes were turned into Towns, Houſes, Lands, and Cattell; and theſe were diſtributed as ſpoils amongſt the Saxon ſouldiers by their Generals, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the maintenance of the State and port of the great men, who were wont to be honoured <hi>non ſtipendiis ſed mune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and the people uſed <hi>ultro &amp; viritum conferre principibus vel armentorum vel frugum aliquid;</hi> but now upon the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conquered Towns, Houſes, Lands, and Cattell in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> a yeerly product of victuals or other ſervice was reſerved and allowed to the Saxon kings by the people, as the people allowed to <hi>Joſhua</hi> his Land, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 19.49. ſo as they needed no longer the former courſe of Offerings, but had enough to maintaine their Royall port, and great ſuperfluity of Demeſnes beſides; as their charity to the Church men does ſufficiently evidence: and by this meanes all the Lands in <hi>England</hi> became mediately or immediately holden of the Crown, and a ſetled maintenance annexed to the ſame; beſides the caſuall profits upon emergencies, or perquiſites of fellons or fugitives goods, mines of Gold and Silver, treaſure trove, mulcts for offences,<note place="margin">Miror. 101, 298 Ll. Edw. cap. 14</note> and other priviledges, which being originally in the kings were by them granted, and made Royalties in the hands of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as at this day.</p>
               <p>To the increaſe of Majeſty and maintenance there was an acceſſe of power, not to make, diſpence with, or alter Laws, but to execute and act the Laws eſtabliſhed: and againſt this power there was no riſing up ſo long as it like an unfethered Arrow gadded not at random. Its true the Church men or Prelates checked them often, but could never give them the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152542:46"/> mate. For peace ſake Kings many times yeelded much; yet would no King of Saxon principles allow of any Canon that extolled the Clergies authority above that of Kings: and though the placing and diſplacing of Biſhops ſeemed to be all Eccleſiaſticall worke, yet would not the Kings altogether connive: as the examples of <hi>Ina</hi> in placing a Biſhop in <hi>Wels, Offa</hi> in making two Provinces of one,<note place="margin">Malmesb. geſt. pontif lib. 3. geſt.

But the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome finding its authority becalmed indured this but as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, till Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the ſeconds time, who by the like trick commended all to the Crown, as from the Papall benediction.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the Saxon Nobility.</head>
               <p>THe ancient Saxon Nobility in <hi>Germany</hi> were the chiefeſt in action both in war, and in peace. That ranke of men was continued by three means, <hi>viz.</hi> by birth or blood, by valour, and by wiſdome: the firſt was rather at the firſt a ſtemme ariſing out of the firſt two, then a different degree or kind: for Noble blood was at the firſt innobled by brave actions, afterward continued in their honour to their poſterity, till by as baſe courſes it was loſt, as it was gained by worthy atchievements; theſe were called <hi>Adelingi.</hi> The nobility of action conſiſted either in matters of war or of peace. Thoſe of peace aroſe principally from wiſdome, which being gained for the moſt part by much experience, were therefore called <hi>Aldermanni</hi> or elder men. The Nobility of war aroſe ſomewhat from valour or courage with wiſdome, but more from good ſucceſſe; for many brave and fortunate Commanders have not been very daring,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 35. Nitard. lib. 4.</note> and the braveſt ſpirits though wiſe have not been ever honoured with good ſucceſſe; theſe were called <hi>Heretochii.</hi> Nevertheleſſe all theſe names or titles were uſed promiſcuouſly in following times, and all called <hi>Nobiles;</hi> but both that and <hi>Duces, Satrapae,</hi> and <hi>Comites</hi> were all of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152542:47"/> Dialect, as the former were of the Saxon. Time alſo brought others into this Honourable band, <hi>viz.</hi> The great Officers of the Kings houſhold, and their atteſts are found amongſt the Kings charters, amongſt the Nobles; And that much advanced the price of Kings; for he that is worthy to be not onely Lord above Nobles, but maſter of ſome, may by a little curteſie prevaile over all. This ſtarry Heaven had ſeverall Orbes:<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> ſome ſo high, as in common eſteem they were next the Imperiall Heaven, having a tincture of Royall blood, and at the next door to the Throne; Others, though not of ſo clear light, had nevertheleſſe no leſſe powerfull influence upon the people, but rather more, by how much more nigher to them. Their power in matters of peace or government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale was exerciſed either collectively or apart and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. In their meetings they ordered the ſmaller emergencies of the publique in convocating and directing the people. <hi>De minoribus rebus conſultant principes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe minora</hi> are ſuch as are ſubſervient to the <hi>majora</hi> and <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> require ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den order touching any particular part or member of the Common-wealth. At other times they viſited their ſeverall Territories or circuits, hearing and determining matters of controverſie, and executing judgement according to the known Lawes. <hi>Principes jura per pagos vicoſque reddunt.</hi> Yet they had <hi>comites</hi> of the Countrey joyned with them,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> whereof afterward. This was their courſe in <hi>German Saxony;</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> the new ſtemme of Kingly power ariſing higher then all the reſt ſucked much from them, and kept them under: for the judiciary power was in time drawn up into the Regall order, and the Lords executed the ſame as deputies from and under him, deſigned thereto by Writs and Commiſſions, as its more particularly noted of King <hi>Alfred.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> The Lords thus leſſened in their judiciary power, carried the leſſe authority in their votes and conſultations. The King was a perpetuall moderator in that worke, and it was no ſmall advantage he had thereby to ſway the Votes. Men that are advanced, if they have any excellency, ſoon gain admiration; and its a hard thing for one that hath yeelded his heart to admiration, to keep it from adoration. This hath mounted up Kings to the top
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152542:47"/> more then their own ambition, and made them undertake what they ought not, becauſe we eſteem more highly of them then we ought. I ſpeak not againſt due, but undue obedience; for had the Saxon Lords remembred themſelves, and the true nature of the authority of their King, they needed not to be amazed at their check, nor to give way to their paſſion,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 333.</note> as they did many times, and adviſed others to doe the like. Nor had Kings by degrees become beyond controlle and uncapable to be adviſed. This errour the Lords eſpied too late, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would remember their ancient right and power, and did take boldneſſe to ſet a Law upon the exorbitancy of their King,<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. An. 854.</note> as in that caſe of <hi>Aethelwolfe</hi> and his Queen amongſt others may appeare: but that was like ſome enterpriſes that owe more to extremity of occaſion then to the courage of the undertaker.</p>

               <p>The moſt inferiour of all were thoſe which were anciently called <hi>Lazzi</hi> or ſlaves; thoſe were the dregs of the people, and wholly at the will of their Lord to do any ſervice, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe any puniſhment;<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and yet the magnanimity of the Saxons was ſuch as they abhorred Tyranny: and it was rarely uſed amongſt them, by beating, torture, impriſonment, or other hard uſage, to compell them to ſerve; they would rather kill them as enemies; and this wrought reverence in theſe men towards their Lords, and maintaintd a kind of generoſity in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152542:48"/> their minds, that they did many brave exploits, and many times not onely purchaſed their own freedome, but alſo brought ſtrength and honour to the Kingdome. And though the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Danes much quelled this Saxon Nobleneſſe, yet was it revived again by the Confeſſors Laws which ordained that the Lords ſhould ſo demeane themſelves towards their men, that they neither incurre guilt againſt God, nor offence againſt the King; or which is all one, to reſpect them as Gods people and the Kings ſubjects.

The Lords were alſo nevertheleſſe in the ſame condition of priviledge as formerly, and though it appeareth that the Kings had gotten the priviledge of ſummoning the grand meeting in his own name, yet it was by advice of the great men, and being met their votes were no other in value then as formerly; for all their Laws were <hi>ex conſilio ſapientum,</hi> and for ought can appeare out of antiquity the vote of the meaneſt continued as

               <p>The matters in agitation in the <hi>Wittagenmot</hi> generally were all both of publique and private concernment.

Afterwards when they had gotten a King into their number, they had ſo much the more worke as might concerne due correſpondency between him and the people, and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards both. This worke was not ſmall, eſpecially in thoſe times of the growth of Kings, but much greater by the acceſſe of Prelates into their number, with whom came alſo a glut of Church affaires, that continually increaſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Prelates ambition ſwelled, ſo as this Councell might ſeem to rule the Church alone in thoſe daies; when as few motions that any way concerned Church-men, but were reſolved into the Prelaticall cogniſance, as the <hi>minora Eccleſiae:</hi> and thus under the colour of the <hi>minora Eccleſiae,</hi> and the <hi>minora Reipublicae,</hi> this mixt Councell of Lords came by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to intermeddle too farre in the <hi>magnalia Regni.</hi>

               <p>AS the condition of States or Kingdoms are diverſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in warre and peace, ſo alſo muſt their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be: for however warre in it ſelfe be but a feaveriſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in a Common-weale, yet in ſome caſes it is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as a kindly ague in due ſeaſon is for the preſervation of the body which many times takes diſtemper rather from the excellency of its conſtitution then from the abundance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Nor did the temper of the Saxon Common-weale ever ſhine more then in warre, whiles it ſet a law upon that which ordinarily is maſter of all miſrule and confuſion, and ſo fought by rule rather then by paſſion. Their chiefe in the firſt times was choſen by the Freemen in the field,<note place="margin">Tacitus. Ll. Edw. cap. 35</note> either at the <hi>Wittagen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> or the <hi>Folkmot,</hi> according to the extent of his command, being carried upon a ſheild born upon their ſholders like as now Knights of the ſhire are. This Emblem they entertained him with, to declare their truſt in him, and the worke that was expected from him. His firſt Title was <hi>Heretock,</hi> afterwards he was called Duke or <hi>Duce;</hi> the latter whereof turned to a bare Title in the concluſion; but the former maintained its owne honour, ſo long as the name laſted. After his election all ſware to be at his Order, and not to forſake him: this was a tricke of imbaſed times;<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> for though the Lacedemonian Law was poſitive, that none ſhould flie or breake his ranke, but get the victory or die, yet were they neither bound by oath or penalty: ſhame in thoſe times being accompted worſe then death by thoſe brave minds. But times growing more old grew alſo more baſe-ſpirited, and could not be (drawn into the field)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152542:52"/> holden in ranke by oathes or honour; and this occaſioned that Law of <hi>Ina</hi> the Saxon King that in ſuch caſe a Countrey Gentleman ſhould be fined 120 ſhillings if he were landed,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Lamb. Cantab. 10.</note> but if otherwiſe, 60 ſhillings, and the Yeoman 30 ſhillings, and afterwards the penalty was increaſed to the forfeiture of all the eſtate of the delinquent.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 528. An. 1009.</note> In their warres they went forth by bodies collectively as they were united by the law of pledges; this made them ſticke cloſe together for the honour of their families and friends,<note place="margin">Tacitus:</note> and rendered their encounters mortall, and to the worſted party commonly fatall: for once beaten in the field they could hardly recover either by rallying or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a new Army. Probable it is that the Lords might have their villaines to follow them in the battaile, but the ſtrength conſiſted of the free men; and though many were bound by tenure to follow their Lords to the wars, and many were vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, yet it ſeems all were bound upon call under perill of fine, and were bound to keepe Armes for the preſervation of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 35.</note> their Lords, and their own perſons, and theſe they might neither paune nor ſell, but leave them to deſcend to their heires, and in default of them to their Lord, and in default of him to their chiefe pledge, and for want of ſuch to the King. They muſtered their armes once every yeere both in Towns and Hundreds, <hi>viz.</hi> the morrow after Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas; and ſuch whoſe bodies were unfit for ſervice were to finde ſufficient men for ſervice in their ſtead. They were ſtrict in their diſcipline,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. cap. 58.</note> if they followed their rule which was made not by the arbitry of the Generall, but by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe amongſt other ſcattered principles concerning Sea-affaires, may ſerve to let us know that the Law-Martiall, and that of the Sea were branches of the poſitive Lawes of the kingdome, ſetled by the generall vote in the <hi>Wittagenmot,</hi> and not left to the will of a lawleſſe Generall or Commander; ſo tender and uniforme were thoſe times both in their Laws and liberties.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of the government of the Saxon Kingdome in times of peace; and firſt of the diviſion of the Kingdome into ſhires, and their Officers.</head>
               <p>IF the Saxon government was regular in time of warre, how much rather in time of peace? All great works are done by parcels and degrees, and it was the Saxons ancient way in <hi>Germany</hi> to divide their Territory into ſeverall circuits or circles, and to aſſigne to each their ſeverall Magiſtrates, all of them ruled by one Law; like one ſoule working in ſeverall members to one common good. Thus they did here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having found the Land already divided into ſeverall governments; they likewiſe what they conquered divided into ſeverall parts called <hi>Comitatus</hi> or Counties, from the word <hi>Comes</hi> that ſignifies a companion; and the Counties thence called are nothing but ſocieties or aſſociations in publique charge and ſervice. But the Saxon word is ſhire or ſhare, that is a portion or precinct of ground belonging to this or that perſon or great Town and bearing the name of that perſon or Town; and ſometimes of the ſcituation of the people, as North or South folke, Eaſt or South Sex or Saxons. This diviſion by the names ſeems to be of Saxon originall, and though by the teſtimony of <hi>Ingulfus</hi> and other writers,<note place="margin">Seld. Tit. Hon.</note> it might ſeem to be done by <hi>Alfred;</hi> yet it will appeare to be more ancient, if the reader minde the grant of <hi>Peter</hi> pence made by King <hi>Offa,</hi> wherein is recorded the ſeverall Dioceſſes and ſhires out of which that grant was made under the very ſame names that they own at this day:<note place="margin">M. Weſtm. An. 794.</note> and that grant was more ancient then <hi>Alfreds</hi> time by the ſpace of 80 yeeres.</p>
               <p>Each of theſe Shires or Counties had their two chiefe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for diſtributive juſtice; of theſe the Sheriffe was more ancient and worthy Officer, being the Lieutenant,<note place="margin">Sheriffs.</note> and ayded by the power of the County in certaine caſes: for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152542:53"/> extended not to leavy warre, but to maintain Juſtice in that County, and within the ſame; and in this work he was partly miniſteriall and partly judiciall: in the one he was the Kings ſervant to execute his Writs; in the other he regulated the Courts of juſtice under his ſurvey.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 35.</note> He was choſen in the County Court called the <hi>Folkmote,</hi> by the votes of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and as the King himſelfe and the <hi>Heretock</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to their honour by the peoples favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Coroners.</note>The Coroner though in originall later, was nevertheleſſe very ancient: he was the more ſervant or Officer to the King, of the two. His worke was to enquire upon view of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter, and by indictment of all felonies as done <hi>contra coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> which formerly were onely <hi>contra pacem,</hi> and triable onely by appeale.<note place="margin">Miror cap. 1.

He was alſo to receive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales of Felonies, and to keep the rolls of the Crown pleas within the County. Its evident he was an Officer in <hi>Alfreds</hi> time;<note place="margin">Miror p. 300.</note> for that King put a Judge to death for ſentencing; one to ſuffer death upon the Coroners record, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delinquent liberty of traverſe.

               <p>THe government of the County in times of peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted much in the adminiſtration of juſtice, which was done in the publique meetings of the Freeholders: &amp; their meetings were either in one place, or in ſeverall parts of the County: in each of which the Sheriff had the mannaging of the acts done there.<note place="margin">Folkmote or County court.</note> The meeting of the Freemen in one place was called the <hi>Folkmote</hi> by the Saxons (ſaving the judgement of the honourable reporter) <hi>Coke inſtit.</hi> 2. p. 69. and of latter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152542:53"/> times the County court: the work wherein was partly for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation &amp; direction concerning the ordering of the County, for the ſafety and peace thereof, ſuch as were redreſſe of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, election of Officers, prevention of dangers, &amp;c. and partly it was Judiciall,<note place="margin">Miror: p. 147.</note> in hearing and determining the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleas of the County, the Church affaires, and ſome treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes done therein, but not matters criminall, for the Biſhop was Judge therein, together with the Sheriffe, and by the Canon he was not to intermeddle in matters of blood: yet neither was the Biſhops nor Sheriffs worke in that Court, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then directory or declaratory; for the Free-men were Judges of the fact, and the other did but <hi>edocere jura populo;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Canut. Miror. cap. 1.

Unto this Court all the free men of the County aſſembled to learne the Law; to adminiſter juſtice,<note place="margin">Ll.

               </p>
               <p>The other Court wherein the Sheriffe had the directory was in the meeting of the free men in ſeverall parts of the County; and this was anciently,<note place="margin">Sheriffs Torne.</note> and now is called the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs

               <p>COunties were too great to meet upon every occaſion; and every occaſion too mean to put the whole County to that charge and trouble: and this induced ſubdiviſions; the firſt whereof is that of the Hundred now, and alſo anciently ſo called, but as ancient (if not more) is the name <hi>Pagus;</hi> for the Hiſtorian tels us that the Germans in the executing of their Lawes,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> a hundred of the free men joyned with the chiefe Lord <hi>per pagos vicoſque,</hi> and in raiſing of forces one hundred were ſelected <hi>ex ſingulis pagis,</hi> which firſt were called <hi>Centenarii</hi> or Hundreders from their number, but uſed for a title of honour like the <hi>Triarii:</hi> And as a ſecond hereunto, I ſhall adde that teſtimony of the Councell at <hi>Berkhamſted,</hi> which ſpeaking of the reduction of ſuits from the Kings Court <hi>ad pagi vel loci praepoſitum,</hi> in other places its rendred to the governours of the Hundred or Burrough. And at this day in <hi>Germany</hi> their Countrey is divided into circuits called <hi>centen</hi> or <hi>canton</hi> and <hi>centengriecht</hi> and the <hi>Hundredere</hi> they call <hi>Centgraven</hi> or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred chiefes,<note place="margin">Cluer. lib. 1. cap. 13.</note> whether for government in time of peace, or for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152542:54"/> command in time of warre; the later whereof, the word <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentake,</hi> doth not a little favour. Amongſt theſe one was <hi>per eminentiam</hi> called the <hi>Centgrave</hi> or Lord of the Hundred, and thereunto elected by the free men of that Hundred, and unto whom they granted a ſtipend in the nature of a rent,<note place="margin">Malmesb. Reg. geſt. p 54.</note> called <hi>Hundredſettena,</hi> together with the government of the ſame. The diviſion of the County in this manner was done by the free men of the County, who are the ſole Judges thereof, if <hi>Polydores</hi> teſtimony may be admitted: and it may ſeem moſt likely that they ruled their diviſion at the firſt according to the multitude of the inhabitants: which did occaſion the great inequality of the Hundreds at this day. The government of the Hundred reſted at the firſt upon the Lord and the Hundre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars; but afterwards by <hi>Alfred</hi> they were found inconvenient,<note place="margin">Ll. Alured cap. 4.</note> becauſe of the multitude, and reduced to the Lord or his Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, and twelve of the Hundred; and theſe twelve were to be ſworn neither to condemne the innocent, nor acquit the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. This was the Hundred court, which by the Law was to be holden once every moneth; and it was a mixt Court of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleas, and Crown pleas:<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. 35, Ll. Aetheldr. 1. Ll. Aethelſt. 20</note> for the Saxon Laws order that in it there ſhould be done juſtice to thieves; and the triall in divers caſes in that Court is by ordeale.

And no ſooner did the defendant appeare, but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the matter charged againſt him, and judgement paſſed before the Court adjourned, except in caſes where immediate proofe was not to be had; albeit it was holden unreaſonable in thoſe daies to hold ſo haſty proceſſe: and therefore the Archb. of <hi>Yorke</hi> preferres the Eccleſiaſticall or Canonicall way before this. Laſtly, in their meeting,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. p. 273. Tacitus. Gloſſar. 155.</note> as well at the Hundred as County Court, they retained their ancient way of comming armed.</p>

               <p>THis was the laſt ſubdiviſion of the County, and that reſted upon the perſons; and it was either not at all or not ſo obſervable as to be worthy of the Roman ſtory; and therefore may rather be thought an extract from <hi>Moſes</hi> law introduced by <hi>Alfred</hi> or his direction. I ſay this reſted on the perſons and not upon the place; for though the Cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were comprehended with certaine bounds; yet the Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were not limited but onely within the limits of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And of theſe alſo it appeareth to me there were divers ſorts; for ſuch matters of controverſie that did ariſe amongſt the Decenners, if of greater moment, were referred to the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Juſtices, which were appointed <hi>ſuper decem decanes,</hi> which I conceive were ten chiefe pledges; and theſe might beare the names of the Centeners, although they be not the <hi>Centgraven;</hi> and the rather I incline thereto becauſe in all probability there muſt needs be above one hundred Freeholders in <hi>Hundredo,</hi> and all free men were Decenners,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. c. 19.</note> that is ranked into ſeverall tens; each one being pledge for others good abearing, and in caſe of default to anſwer it before the judge; and in caſe of default of appearance his nine pledges ſhould have one and thirty daies to bring the delinquent forth to juſtice. If this failed, then the chiefe of thoſe Decenners by the votes of that and the neighbour Decennaries, was to purge himſelfe and his fellow pledges both of the guilt of the fact, and of being parties to the flight of the delinquent. And if they could not this do, then were they by their own oathes to acquit themſelves, and to bind themſelves to bring the delinquent to juſtice as ſoon as they could, &amp; in the mean time to pay the dammage out of the eſtate of the delinquent: and if that were not ſufficient, then out of their own eſtate; but if the delinquents eſtate was ſufficient, the ſurpluſſage thereof remained with the pledges. And laſtly, the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152542:55"/> Maſter of the family was a pledge for his whole family.<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. cap. 15 Ll. Canut. c. 28</note> This was the Law of Decenners, and may ſeem to be ſomewhat a rigorous law, not onely in caſe of delinquency, but alſo for their abode, for none of them might depart from their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without conſent of his fellow pledges,<note place="margin">Ll. Alured cap. 33. Ll. Canut. p. 2. cap. 15.</note> nor out of the County without allowance of the Sheriffe, or other Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſame.

Theſe are called exemptions, but more ordinarily Francheſes, from which ſcarce any part of the Kingdome remained free; and are to be conſidered eithet in regard of the place or perſon. In the later I intend that of the Churchmen, whoſe perſons and eſtates in many particulers were exempted from the civill power of this Kingdom. Their perſons devoted to a peculiar worke, they would have to be under a peculiar Law, called the Canon law; which at the firſt extended onely to their own perſons, and that onely <hi>pro reformatione morum:</hi>

This was therefore a third, different, and mixt government, agreed upon joyntly between the Britons and Saxons, who after a long and burdenſome warre, wherein both peoples were well wearied by degrees became friends, entered traffique and into the ſtricteſt ſocieties by marriage. Thus finding the ſweetneſſe of peace, they provide againſt future occaſions of ſtrife that might ariſe in commerce by the juſtling of two Laws together, &amp; agree in one law, &amp; upon a certain number of Judges elected by common conſent, who were to ſee to the execution of theſe Laws as joynt aſſeſſors. From theſe as I conceive aroſe thoſe which are now called the Lords marchers,<note place="margin">Ll.

It ſeemeth this form of government was firſt inſtituted by <hi>Aetheldred,</hi> and by way of preſcription or cuſtome continueth till this day: and as it was the birth of truce, ſo for the future became both mother and nurſe of peace between thoſe two peoples, like the twilight between the day and night, untill both were brought under one head, and by divine providence ſetled in a laſting day.</p>

               <p>NEvertheleſſe moſt of theſe liberties, if not all of them were many times granted by Kings as appendent to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; which were Francheſes of ſmaller circuit being at the firſt portions of ground granted to ſome particular perſons, and by them ſubdivided and granted over to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to hold of the Grantors by rents, ſervices, and ſuit to one Court, all being no other then the ſpoiles of warre, and rewards of valour, or other ſervice. Theſe in their collective nature are called a Manor, and by continuance of time become a kind of body politique. In antiquity its called <hi>Manſum</hi> from the manſion houſe, although it is not of the Eſſence of a Manor,<note place="margin">Bracton. fo. 212</note> nor ought the words of <hi>Bracton</hi> to be conſtrued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the literall ſence; for the houſe may be deſtroyed, and yet the Manor continue; and the ground was granted in tenure before any houſe built thereupon. The quantity of the ground thus given to hold by ſervice was according to the pleaſure of the Lord more or leſſe, and therefore might extend into divers Pariſhes, as on the other part one Town might comprehend divers Manors.<note place="margin">Flera. lib. 4. cap. 15.</note> The Eſtate that was granted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended partly on the condition of the Grantee: for ſome were <hi>ſervi</hi> or bondmen, and their Eſtate was altogether at the will of the Lord, as was alſo the benefit; but the ſervants merit, and the Lords benignity concurring with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Religion, as the light grew more cleare, abated the rigour of the tenure into that which we now call Copyhold. Other Eſtates were made to the Free men, which in the firſt times were onely for yeers; albeit therein they were not nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly, for they ſticked not at Leaſes for a hundred yeeres,<note place="margin">Ingulſus Croyl.</note> yet with a render of rent, which in thoſe daies was of Corn or other Victuall; and thence the Leaſes ſo made were called <hi>Feormes</hi> or Farmes, which word ſignifieth Victuals: But times enſuing turned the victuall into money, and terms of yeers
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152542:58"/> to terms of life and inheritance, retaining the rents, and thoſe called Quit rents, or the rents of thoſe perſons that are acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or free.<note place="margin">Gloſſ. 158. Ll. Saxon 16, 17. Lamb. Gloſſ. 348. Ll. Canut. p. 1. cap. 69.</note> But in caſe of eſtates of inheritance for the moſt part after the death of the Tenants were reſerved Heriots or a reliefe: which were not left to the will of the Lord, but was put in certainty, in the very letter of the Law: for according to each mans degree, ſuch was his reliefe or heriot.</p>
               <p>But over and above all, they reſerved ſpeciall ſervice to be done by the perſon of the Tenant, or ſome other by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, of which thoſe that were their <hi>ſervi</hi> or villains were at the will of the Lord: others had their particular ſervice ſet down in their grants.<note place="margin">Knight-ſervice.</note> Theſe concerned either warre or peace; the former was afterwards called the ſervice of the Knight or Souldier; the later the ſervice of the Husbandman or Plough. That of the Souldier was the more honourable, and ſuitable to the old German trade; <hi>Pigrum &amp; iners videtur ſudore acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere quod poſſis ſanguine parare:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and the worke was to defend the Kingdom, the Lords perſon and honour; and to this end he was ever to have his weapons in readineſſe, which gave name to the ſervice, and altered as times and cuſtomes changed. This ſervice by cuſtome from a worke degenerated into the bare Title, and became a dignity; and the men named, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entituled <hi>Milites:</hi> and many of the Saxon charters were atteſted by men bearing that Title; yet the ſervice it ſelfe was farre more ancient, and called <hi>ſervicium loricae,</hi> of which ſort alſo were the <hi>Cuſtodes pagani</hi> that wore a Helmet, a coat of Maile, and a guilt Sword: not unlike the old German way of calling forth of their <hi>Tirones</hi> to the war.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Of this ranke ſome were more eminent then others; for ſome bare the ſingle title of Knight, and it ſeemed ſerved on foot: Others ſerved on horſeback, and were called Radknights, or Knights riders, as <hi>Bracton</hi> noteth;<note place="margin">Selden. Spicil.</note> and theſe I take to be the <hi>Vavaſours,</hi> noted in the Conquerours Laws: for that their reliefe is a Helmet, a Cote of Maile, a Shield, a Speare, and a horſe. Now for the maintaining of this ſervice, they had Lands and Tenements called Knights Fees, which bound the owner to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, into whoſe hands ſoever they came, to be done either by the perſon of the owner or other fit perſon by him procured,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152542:58"/> and therefore were diſcharged from the payment of all taxes and tollage, which was the Law of the Goths of old,<note place="margin">Co. Litlet. 75.

The number of theſe Fees much increaſed, ſo as in the Conquerours time they were above ſixty thouſand, which was a mighty body for a ſmall Iſland, and brought much honour to the Nation.</p>
               <p>But the profit aroſe from beneath,<note place="margin">Soccage tenure.</note> I mean from the ſoccage tenure or ſervice of the Plough, which in the firſt times was performed by thoſe that were unfit for the ſervice of the wars, either being green and young, or decrepet and aged;<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the women. But after that the Saxon conqueſt was at a ſtop, and that no more was to be gotten by blood, men endeavoured to ſatisfie their deſires by ſweat, and turned their Swords into Ploughſhares; and thus the Husbandry increaſed exceedingly, and hath proved the beſt pillar of the Common-weale: the nature of this tenure is fully ſet out by the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Co.

               <p>BY grants made by Lords unto Tenants already noted, the Lords had power by common right to call their Tenants before them and enquire concerning their payment of rents, and performance of ſervices, which became Courts of conſtant appointment: of which ſort there were two, one for the free men, the other for the bond men; and this brought forth an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152542:59"/> other ſervice,<note place="margin">Court-leet.</note> which we call ſuite of Court. The Court of Free men was holden from three weeks to three weeks, wherein the free men,<note place="margin">Miror p. 17. Lind. gloſſ. Albin. hiſt. Saxon. p. 72.</note> as in the Hundred and County were Judges of the fact, and from them named, as at this day Court leete, or the Court of the Liti, or ſuch as are manumitted or free men. In this Court all actions or ſuits between the free men of the ſame Manor, and within the ſame ariſing, were determined; nor could any Court (no not the Kings) intermeddle with ſuch ſuits before triall had, but by the Lords allowance: And upon this priviledge the Writ of right patent was grounded. But the full nature of this Court is not within my intention, but I muſt referre the Reader to the Law-bookes.<note place="margin">F. N. Br. 2.</note> For it was the leaſt part of the worke and power which this Court ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by continuance of time; in regard that manors excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly multiplied, ſo as no part of the Land was left free; and many one of them extended into divers Decennaries, the Lords obtained great power over them,<note place="margin">View of Frankpledge.</note> and had of Kings grants of view of Frankpledge within their ſeverall Lordſhips; and further power of inquiry and puniſhing of matters of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique nuſance, and ſuch as were <hi>contra pacem &amp; coronam;</hi> which by cuſtome became annexed unto the Court-leete. The nuſances of Copy-holds being done to diſheriſon of the Lord, and not proper for the Court of publique inquiry. The Judge of this Court-leet was the Lord, or his Steward, for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory part; and the Steward was properly Coroner within the Manor to take preſentments, and certifie them to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner of the County. And thus this Court ſwallowed up much of the power of the Decenners Court in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, ſo as we finde no footſteps of any Writ of Right to the Decenners or chiefe pledges, but contrarywiſe many views of Frank pledge granted to particular perſons in the time of <hi>Alfred:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror cap. 5. Sec. 1</note> and many things done by the chiefe pledges in the Courts of theſe Manors, as is to be yet ſeen in many ancient Court Rols.</p>
               <p>The other Court which by common right belonged to the Lords of Mannors was that of the Copyholders,<note place="margin">Court Baron.</note> called or rather included under the name of the Court Baron, which albeit it is called in the ordinarily ſtile <hi>Curia Baronum,</hi> yet not

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152542:60"/> when they found no enemies amongſt them. This ſolitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cuſtome could not be ſoon ſhaken off, and might well occaſion multitudes of Towns in thoſe times (though ſmall ones doubtleſſe) that writers ſpeake of; if true it be that after the waſting times of the Danes and Normans in the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours time were found in <hi>England</hi> forty five thouſand Pariſhes, and ſixty two thouſand Villages. Nor was peace leſſe beneficiall to them then they carefull of it; for by continuance of peace, Husbandry, Manifactures, and Commerce occaſioned people to gather to places commodious for habitation in good ſoile nigh navigable Rivers or Havens, and according to their ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and trade, ſo they ſwelled in multitude or decayed, ſome of whom growing more eminent then others, more care was had of their government and ſafety; for the later by building of Wals and Caſtles, and for the former by ſetling a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy peculiar to that place or Townſhip; not as ſo many Decenners, but as one body conſiſting of many members; and thus by cuſtome they grew to be Fraternities, or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations under one Magiſtrate or head, whom they called Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman; and held a Court of Juſtice (at the firſt holden twice a yeere) which was in nature of a Leet with a view of Frank pledge,<note place="margin">Ll. Canut. cap. 44. Miror cap. 5. Sec. 1. <hi>Markets.</hi>
                  </note> as may appeare in the caſes of <hi>Dorceſter, Circeter,</hi> and <hi>Doncaſter,</hi> in <hi>Alfreds</hi> time; and herewith they had publique markets which ſerved them for their better convenience.</p>
               <p>This priviledge of Market was a liberty of publique ſale and trade in commodities that principally concerne the belly, but by common courſe became a paſſe for commodities of every kind almoſt. Concerning this liberty I ſhall deſire leave to enterpoſe this parentheſis enſuing before I proceed in the intended diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In the firſt times as every man by common right had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in his own goods, ſo by the ſame right he had power to alien them to any perſon, at any time, in any place, by gift, ſale, exchange, or other waies; and that by ſuch alienation, but eſpecially by ſale a right was veſted in the buyer againſt all men (ſaving the Eignee right which was recompenced upon warranty and recovery in value) and in thoſe daies common ſence taught men to buy or ſell, of or to the next neighbour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152542:60"/> that would bargaine with them: and for want of ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to repaire to the next aſſembly, meeting, or concourſe of people, for the ſale of ſuch commodities as their neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood would not take off their hands. And thus the greater Towns that had walls or Caſtles became the greateſt Markets, and others leſſe; and this made the neighbourhood of thoſe Towns to repaire thither to buy, as others to ſell. But time diſcovering a double inconvenience herein, <hi>viz.</hi> that by theſe leſſe publique ſales in ſmaller Villages, where little or no care of right or juſtice was had (and by which means the word Pagan became a word of reproach) many mens goods by clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine contracts were loſt, and no care had of their recovery; and (which was yet more prejudiciall to the publique) that the greater Towns appointed for the ſtrength and defence of the Kingdome became ill provided with ſupply of victuall, either for the preſent or future; and what was had for the moſt part was gotten at the ſecond hand, and higher rate then the Countrey Villages had. The wiſe men by publique edict laid a reſtraint of Markets in ſmaller Villages, and more private places; and thus the greater Towns having Markets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly became more publique Markets, not by any new right or priviledge from the Crown (for it neither had ſuch power, nor could have, but upon uſurpation) againſt the common right of ſuch Towns and places of publique defence. This reſtraint upon the reaſons aforeſaid, was made firſt in the Saxon times as may appeare by their Laws, but more clearly declared and confirmed afterwards by the Laws of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, which never gave any new right of Market overt unto thoſe places of publique defence, but onely did inhibit the ſame in the ſmaller Villages and private places. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect although the Kings of this Nation in future times tooke leave to aboliſh that reſtraint which did lie upon ſome of thoſe more private places for certaine reaſons of State; and ſo theſe places became Markets overt which formerly were none; yet could they never take away that priviledge which nature it ſelfe caſt upon thoſe greater Towns being the very limbs of the Kingdome, without wrong done to common right and the publique good: nor abridge them of that power, but that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152542:61"/> they might ſtill uſe their liberty at times and places within their precinct, as might beſt conduce with the benefit of the inhabitants of thoſe places, even as any particular free man may govern his own eſtate as him liketh beſt. And thus upon the whole matter its to be concluded, that the ancient Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs of this Kingdome properly doe not hold their liberty of Market overt by preſcription or charter, but by common right, and not as a Corporation made by charter; but as they are a multitude of people anciently gathered together and united, upon whom the ſtrength and wealth of the Kingdom doth or did formerly much more depend then on any of the ſmaller Villages &amp; open Towns; even as every free man poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and uſeth his proper inheritance and eſtate without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priviledge derived from the Crown: nor can the King take away the liberty of Market overt from ſuch places, more then he can take away the liberty of buying and ſelling from any free man, to whom the Law alloweth a liberty of owner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. This I ſubmit to the cenſure of the learned in the Laws, in regard of the different opinions concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>This liberty of Townſhip thus made, and the place and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inhabitants thereof being of ſuch conſequence in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique adminiſtration, had for their better ſupport and ſafety liberty of Fortification,<note place="margin">Ll.

               <p>BEſides other prerogatives of the Saxon Kings, they had alſo a Franchiſe for wild beaſts for the Chaſe, which we commonly call Forreſt, being a precinct of ground neither parcell of the County nor the Dioceſſe, nor of the Kingdome,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152542:61"/> but rather appendant thereunto. This ſavoured of the old German ſport, but by cuſtome turned from ſport to earneſt. For although in the firſt times the Saxons were ſo few, and the Country ſo ſpacious, that they might allow the beaſts their farme as well as themſelves their own; People nevertheleſſe ſo multiplyed, as of neceſſity they muſt intercommon either with Beaſts or Fiſhes: the former whereof, however more cleanly, yet the latter had the ſureſt footing, and was choſen as the leaſt of two evils, rather then for any likelyhood of good neighbourhood: for as nature taught beaſts to prey for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo men to defend their owne; and this bred ſuch a fewd between beaſts and men, as that Kings doubting to looſe their game, tooke in with the weaker; that the world might ſee the happineſſe of <hi>England,</hi> where beaſts enjoy their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as men. But this was, as it were, by compromiſe; for it had been very hard to have pleaſed the free men, who had liberty of game within their own ground by common right,<note place="margin">Ll.

               <p>FOr the proceedings in courſe the Saxons were wont to begin with matters belonging to the Church, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſecular cauſes; In which if the matters were criminall the moſt ancient way of proceeding was by appeale of the party complaining; but afterwards in caſes that concerned dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, injury, or violence done to the body of a man or his eſtate, the King was found to be therein prejudiced, beſides the prejudice immediately done to the ſubject; for a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in body or eſtate is diſabled to ſerve the King and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;<note place="margin">Indictment.</note> and upon this ground a way was found out to puniſh the offender by indictment, beſides the ſatisfaction done to the party wronged. The proceedings againſt ſuch delinquents were by attachment of the party,<note place="margin">Lambert. Ll. Inae. 15.</note> who thereupon gave pledges for his appearance. If the party could not be found, a <hi>fugam fecit</hi> was returned, and that was a conviction in Law, and purſuit was made after the party by huy and cry. If he was thereby taken, the ancient way was that of <hi>Halifax</hi> law; but in later times he was impriſoned,<note place="margin">Ll. Inae: Lam: fo. 7. Ll. Alured cap. 6. Miror: c. 2. Sec. 24. Ll.

If the delinquent was found upon the huy and cry, and would not yeeld himſelfe, he was in repute a common enemy, and (as a wolfe) any man might kill him; as the Law was alſo the ſame in caſe of Utlary. At the time of tryall (if at the Kings ſuit) the delinquent was indicted in this manner by any party preſent: <hi>I, D.C. do ſay for the King, that I. S. is defamed by good men; that he upon — day of —&amp;c. into the houſe and goods of — did caſt fire, and the ſame did burn:</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> by witneſſes, and twelve men. But if the complaint was at the ſuit of the party, then the proſecutor ſued him upon Appeale, in manner following: <hi>I. C. appealeth D. H. here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for that E father, brother, ſonne, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle</hi> (according as the caſe was) <hi>to I.C. being in the peace of God, and of our Soveraigne Lord the King in the dwelling houſe of E. at—&amp;c. the ſaid D.H. upon the—day of—in the—yeere of—with a Sword made a wound of two inches long, and ſix inches deep in the left pappe of the body of the ſaid E. whereof he died; and this was done feloniouſly, and of malice forethought. And if the ſaid D.H. ſhall deny the ſame, the ſaid I.C. is ready to prove the ſame againſt him by his body, or as a Monk, woman, or Clerk behooveth to prove the ſame,</hi> that is, by Champion; for neither Monke, woman, nor Clerke was by Law to juſtifie by battaile in their own perſon. The ſeverall cauſes of appeale and indictment may be found in the Law bookes, to whom I referre the Reader, it not being within the compaſſe of this diſcourſe to fall upon the particulars: I ſhall onely obſerve the difference between Indictments former and later, and between them and appeales, <hi>viz.</hi> that appeales are poſitive accuſations in the name of the proſecutor of the fact done by the party appealed; whereas indictments were onely a publication or affirmation of the fame of a fact done by the party indicted, and wherein not guilty pleaded, ſerved onely as in nature of a Quere, to uſher in the votes of the free men.</p>
               <p>Concerning the fact ſecondly the difference between for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Indictments from theſe in theſe daies, conſiſts in this, that the ancient Indictments were in the name of one man: thoſe of the later ſort are in the name of the Jury, and the former were onely of a fame, the later of the fact.</p>

                  </note>A third way of bringing controverſies unto judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned onely ſuch matters as were of leſſe conſequence; and theſe were introduced by way of preſentment, in the name or behalfe of the King, in nature of poſitive accuſe of one for a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152542:63"/> crime firſt laid down generally, and then aſſerted by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fact, in this manner: <hi>I ſay, for our Soveraigne Lord the King, that H. here is perjured, and hath broken faith againſt the King, becauſe whereas H. is or was Chancellor of the King, and was ſworn that he would not ſell right, or any remediall Writ to any one: yet upon the—day of—&amp;c. he ſold to B. a Writ of Attaint, and would not grant the ſame under halfe a Marke:</hi> ſo as the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between an Indictment and Preſentment in thoſe daies was onely in the degree of crime for which the party delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent was accuſed, and in the manner of concluſion of the Preſentment, which was without averment.</p>
               <p>The laſt way of trials concerns ſuch offences that exceed not the nature of treſpaſſe done to a mans perſon or his goods:<note place="margin">Miror cap. 2. Sec. 24. <hi>Action.</hi>
                  </note> and this was by way of Action, and it was to obtaine recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for dammage ſuſtained. Now becauſe the former were called perſonall treſpaſſes the Proceſſe was by attachment of the perſon, who thereupon put in baile, or elſe his perſon was ſecured by impriſonment till triall, and ſatisfaction made; but in the later that concerned the realty,<note place="margin">Ll.

But if the party appeared in former times, he anſwered forthwith, and judgement paſſed without delay, as hath been ſaid; unleſſe in urgent caſes, where the matter was raw, and then it was adjourned, and pledges given by the defendant to the full value,<note place="margin">Ll.

But in after times for better and more adviſed proceeding the defendant was admitted to his Eſſoines; yet with a proviſo,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 5.

The firſt put the matter to the judgement of the free men; the ſecond to the judgement of the Judge; the third to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the complainant, whereby the defendant generally found mercy, and in caſe of treſpaſſe rendred leſſe dammage. I finde no footſteps in thoſe times of Dilatory pleas: or demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or other delays, unleſſe in caſe of infancy; for the Saxons knew no other age of ability to doe or ſuffer,<note place="margin">Lindenbr. gloſſ.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVIII.</hi> Of the ordinary manner of triall amongſt the Saxons by Inqueſt.</head>
               <p>THe laſt and moſt ordinary way of triall was by witneſſes (upon travers of the matter in fact) before the Jurors,<note place="margin">Inqueſt.</note> and their vote thereupon: this made the Verdict, and it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the matter in fact. In former time queſtionleſſe it was a confuſed manner of triall, by votes of the whole multitude, which made the verdict hard to be diſcerned: but time taught them better advice, to bring the voters to a certaine number, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Graecian way, who determined controverſies by the ſuffrages of foure and thirty, or the major part of them.<note place="margin">Emmius.</note> But how the number came to be reduced to twelve I cannot conjecture, unleſſe in immitation of that rule of compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that ordinarily exceeded not that number. The firſt law that defined this number was that of <hi>Aetheldred</hi> about 300 yeeres before the conqueſt. <hi>In ſingulis Centuris, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. 675. Ll. Sax. Lamb.</note> In Engliſh thus: In every Century or Hundred let there be a Court, and let twelve ancient free men, together with the Lord of the Hundred be ſworn that they will not condemn the innocent, nor acquit the guilty: And this was ſo ſtrictly eyed, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> put one of his Judges to death for paſſing ſentence upon a verdict corruptly obtained, upon the votes of the Jurors,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> whereof three of the twelve were in the negative. And the ſame King put another of his Judges to death, for paſſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon an <hi>ignoramus,</hi> returned by the Jury: and a third, for condemning a man upon an Inqueſt taken <hi>ex officio,</hi> when as the Delinquent had not put himſelfe upon their triall.</p>
               <p>But the Saxons were yet more carefull of the credit and life of man,<note place="margin">Two Juries.</note> for no mans life or credit reſted altogether upon the caſt of twelve opinions: but firſt twelve men inquired of the fame and ground thereof, which if liked rendred the party under the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152542:66"/> ſpot of delinquency, and meet to be looked upon as under the ſuſpition of the Law, who formerly was but under the ſuſpect of ſome particuler man. And then was a ſecond enquiry of the fact, if the party traverſed the vote of Fame. In both which trials the verdict grounded it ſelfe upon thoſe <hi>allegata</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata</hi> which were before them. The firſt of theſe inquiries was before the Coroner, who even in thoſe old daies had the view of bloodſhed. The ſecond was had before the Judge of life and death: neither of which could legally indammage the party without the other, unleſſe the Judge meaned to anſwer it with the perill of his own perſon and eſtate, as it befell in <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, when as a Judge ſuffered death for paſſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the Coroners onely record, unto which a replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is allowed,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> as the booke ſaith; and another Judge had the ſame meaſure for condemning one without appeale or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment foregoing. Where by the way I may note another difference between Appeales and Indictments,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 2. Sec. 11.</note> in this, that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales were and are the more ſpeedy trials then Indictments, in as much as the former were but one act, the later two.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Medietas Linguae.</note>And yet time and experience refined this way of triall into a more excellent condition: For the bloody times of the Saxons firſt age paſſing over, and peace ariſing by degrees, they together with the Britons began to <hi>intercomon,</hi> and about the Marches become a mixt people under a mixture of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Lawes (as hath been already noted) amongſt which one concerned their way of triall of matters in fact by a Jury mixt both of Britons and Saxons,<note place="margin">Ll. Aetheldr. cap. 3. Lamb.</note> which was ſetled by a law made by <hi>Aetheldred. Viri ſint, &amp;c.</hi> In Engliſh thus: Let there be twelve men of underſtanding in the law, ſix of them Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and ſix Welſh; and let them deale juſtice both to Engliſh and Welſh. The equity of this law in future ages ſpread it ſelfe into all trials of Foraigners in every place throughout this Iſland. Unto ſuch as ſtumble at this conceipt, becauſe they are ſaid to be <hi>aetate ſuperiores,</hi> and <hi>jure conſulti,</hi> I ſhall onely note thus much: that it is not to be doubted but the worke of Jurors required chiefe men both for experience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the cuſtomes of thoſe times, to enable them to judge of the matter in fact, and upon whoſe judgement the life and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152542:66"/> death of the party reſted principally: and as probable it is that thoſe Jurors, as they were then chiefe men, ſo they ſate in the moſt eminent place of the aſſembly or court, and were coaſſeſſors with the Biſhop and Sheriffe who did ſerve, but onely to adviſe the reſt, and they or one of them to publiſh the ſentence which the Law predetermined: And this chiefe place the Jurors might have poſſeſſed at this day, as they doe in <hi>Sweden,</hi> had the chiefe men holden the ſervice ſtill worthy of their attendance.</p>
               <p>But great men grew too great in their own eſteem for the ſervice of their Countrey,<note place="margin">Peeres.</note> betaking themſelves to ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and matters of higheſt imployment were left to thoſe of the meaner condition, who being in their own perſons of leſſe admiration, were thought unmeet to ſit in ſuch eminent places, and ſo from the bench deſcended to the floore, as at this day. This deſidiouſneſſe of the greater ſort made one ſtep further to the full perfection of that Manner of triall both of the perſons and eſtates of the Engliſh, which hath been the envy of other Nations, and is called the triall <hi>per pares</hi> or by Peeres. For the pride of the Danes (now growing into one people with the Saxons) not induring ſuch fellowſhip with the mean Saxon free men in this publique ſervice; and the wiſe Saxon King eſpying the danger in betruſting the lives and eſtates of the pooreſt ſort unto the dictate of theſe ſuperbient humours; and on the contrary in proſtituting the Nobler blood unto the vote of the inferiour ranke of men, provided a third way, and by agreement between him and <hi>Gunthurne</hi> the Dane, ſetled the law of Peeres.<note place="margin">Ll. Alured.</note> 
                  <hi>Si miniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, &amp;c.</hi> If a Lord or Baron be accuſed of homicide, he ſhall be acquitted by twelve Lords: but if of inferiour ranke,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. fo. 499.</note> he ſhall be acquitted by eleven of his equals and one Lord. Thus Gods providence diſpoſed of the pride of men, to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of its own reſtraint; for the great men ere they were aware hereby loſt one of the faireſt flowers of their Garland, <hi>viz.</hi> the judicature, or rather the maſterſhip of the life or death of the meaner ſort; and thereby a faire opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them for ever under their aw. And no leſſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was the benefit that redounded to this Nation hereby, for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152542:67"/> had the great men holden this power, as once they had it, it might ſoon have endangered the liberty of the free men, and thereby been deſtructive to the Fundamentall conſtitution of the government of this Realme, which conſiſteth in the juſt and equall participation of theſe priviledges, wherein all are equally concerned. This was the triall wherein the people of this Nation were made happy above all other people, and whereby the free men, as they had the legiſlative power, ſo likewiſe had the juridicall; and thereby next under God an abſolute dominion over themſelves and their eſtates: for though this courſe of triall was firſt applied to matters of crime, yet it ſoon alſo ſeiſed upon the Common pleas, which for the moſt part was the worke of main import in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Court; and ſuitable hereunto are the preſcriptions which are extant in the Law-books of cogniſance of pleas, and writs of Aſſize, &amp;c. from the times of the Saxons, as in that caſe of the Abbot of <hi>Bury</hi> amongſt others doth appeare.<note place="margin">26. aff. pl. 24.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Of the penall laws amongſt the Saxons.</head>
               <p>PAſſing the Courts and manner of proceedings till ſentence we are now come to the particular Laws that directed the ſentence, and firſt of thoſe that concerned criminall offences. During the Saxons time the Common-wealth was in its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, the government tender, the Laws green and ſubject to bend according to the blaſt of time and occaſion, and according to the different diſpoſitions of governours, ages, and peoples. For though the Saxons were in name our firſt matter, yet not they onely; but they having once made the breach open, and entered this Iſland it became a common ſewer to the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcency of thoſe Eaſterne peoples of the Angles, Danes, Almains, and Goths; as their ſeverall Lawes left with us in power doe not obſcurely informe us; and amongſt all the reſt the Goths were not the leaſt concerned herein; for the Saxon King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what people ſhall be holden Deniſins in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſaith that the Goths ought to be received and protected in this Kingdome, as ſworn brethren, kinſmen, and proper Citizens of this Common-weale. Nor can any Nation upon earth ſhew ſo much of the ancient Gothique law as this Iſland hath. Nevertheleſſe in this mixture of people of ſeverall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there being a ſuitable mixture of Laws, as the power of any one of theſe peoples changed, ſo likewiſe did their Laws change in power; and long it was ere a right temper of one uniforme law could be ſetled, yet in the interim theſe ſhort remembrances left unconſumed by time, I have ſubjoyned, that it may appeare their notions were excellent, though ſomewhat inconſtant in their practice.</p>
               <p>Thoſe times were darke, and yet ſo farre as any light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the people were to be honoured for their reſolution in the defence thereof. For there was few of the Commandements of the two Tables which they did not aſſert by Laws by them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152542:68"/> made, the third and tenth excepted; which latter commands the inward man onely, and whereof God hath the ſole cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</p>
               <p>True it is that the firſt Commandement containeth much of the ſame nature; yet ſomewhat is viſible,<note place="margin">The firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and that they bound; for whereas in thoſe times the Divell had ſuch power as he did prevaile with ſome,<note place="margin">Witchery.</note> and thoſe it may be not a few, to renounce God, and deliver themſelves wholly to his owne will; they puniſhed this crime with baniſhment as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their ſociety that would communicate with Divels, yet if the delinquent had done any miſchiefe whereby death enſued, the parties puniſhment was death;<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. cap: 6.</note> yet might all be diſcharged by ranſome, and good ſecurity for good behaviour for time to come.</p>
               <p>For their worſhip of God they were no leſſe zealous in maintenance of the manner;<note place="margin">The ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as their forefathers liked not the uſe of Images or pictures for adoration, neither did they: and although the clergy in other matters led them much, yet in this they were alone for a long time; for although the Roman Church had the uſe of Images above three hundred yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Auſtins</hi> comming, yet could not that cuſtome faſten upon the Saxons for the ſpace of above one hundred yeeres after <hi>Auſtins</hi> comming, notwithſtanding the endeavours of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> and Pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by his baſtard decree begotten upon the dream of the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> that ſaw the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> picture brought him in his ſleep by her ſelfe, and with a command from her that it ſhould be ſet up in the Church and worſhipped:<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 218.</note> I ſay it could not faſten any conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Idoll worſhip, nor ever wreſt a Law from the <hi>Witta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genmot</hi> to countenance the ſame; but rather on the contrary they ſtill preſerved the memoriall of the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Decalogue even then when as the Romaniſts had expunged the ſame out of the number;<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 364 Ll. Canut. c. 5</note> and they inforced the ſame by a law of their own making, ſo far as their Clergy, or reverence they bare to <hi>Rome</hi> would allow.</p>
               <p>It hath been formerly obſerved that the Saxons tooke no note of the vice of prophane ſwearing and curſing;<note place="margin">The third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which crime (if it were in uſe, as it cannot be otherwiſe conceited but it
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152542:69"/> was) as the times then were muſt lie upon the Clergymens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for their neglect of teaching the poynt, or upon the generall ignorance of thoſe times, which underſtood not the Commandement, nor the Scripture. For we finde no Canon againſt it, nor ſcarce any doctrine concerning it, but onely in caſe of falſe ſwearing, till <hi>Anſelms</hi> time. True it is that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſeemeth zealous againſt all ſwearing; but that was his perſonall goodneſſe, which for ought appeareth died with him. And <hi>Anſelme</hi> contending againſt ſwearing by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and idle ſwearing, renders his grounds in ſuch manner as it may be well conceived that he underſtood not the maine.<note place="margin">Cent. 11. cap. 4. de lege.</note>

                  <note place="margin">The fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>I am the rather induced to conceive charitably of thoſe times in regard of their exceeding zeale for the honour of the Lords day; which ſheweth, that ſo farre as their knowledge would maintaine them they had zeale to make it into action. They began this day doubtleſſe as other daies, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of their forefathers in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Nox ducere diem videtur.</hi> And becauſe they would not allow their ſecular affaires to trench too nigh that daies devotion, they made the Lords day to begin upon Saturday at three of the clocke in the afternoon, and to continue till Munday morning.<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 445. 446.</note> No paſtime, no not their beloved ſport of hunting, was allowed during all that time: nor no works were to be done, but ſuch as concerned the worſhip of God; and thoſe laws they bound with penalty of fine, if the delinquent were a free man; if he were a bond ſervant, he was to be whipped: Nor were theſe the Laws of one King,<note place="margin">Ibid. 268, 377, 404, 518, 546.</note> or age onely, but of the whole currant of the Saxon government, and may, although darke times they were, yet put us in theſe daies of light to the bluſh, to enter into compare with them for their devotion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>In their converſation with men the Saxons ſeemed yet more ſtrict, and being a people of a publique ſpirit, they preferred the good of their Countrey above all; accounting treachery againſt it, or neglect thereof in time of danger to be a crime of the greateſt concernment,<note place="margin">Treaſon.</note> and to be puniſhed in the higheſt degree.<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Proditores &amp; transfugas arboribus ſuſpendunt.</hi> Other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then this, no not againſt Kings, did they then acknowledge
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152542:69"/> any; and therefore the form of the Indictment for contriving the death of their King concluded only <hi>Felonice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror cap. 2. Sec. 11.</note> as may appeare in that form of an indictment for an offence of that nature intended and plotted againſt <hi>Edmond</hi> the Saxon King: when as for the plotting againſt aliance, though of common and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour nature, the Indictment concluded <hi>felonice &amp; proditorie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Miror cap. 2.

               <p>If in any thing the Saxons were indulgent,<note place="margin">The ſixth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> it was in matters of blood; for they were a warlike people, and looked upon it as under the regiment of valour; and therefore it was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed onely with fine, according to the old rule,<note place="margin">

               <p>THus paſſing over ſome tops of Saxon penall Laws, beſides the general rule or law of eye for eye, tooth for tooth, &amp;c. it now remains as lightly to glance at a few generals concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſetling and property of poſſeſſions in point of title;<note place="margin">Miror cap. 5. Sec. 1.</note> Concerning which, although it be true that the conquerours of this part of the Iſle were a body aggregate of many Nations or peoples; and ſo divers cuſtomes muſt neceſſarily ſettle by common intendment in ſeverall places, according as they choſe their habitation:<note place="margin">Inheritance.</note> yet the generall cuſtome of the Germans, as touching diſcent of inheritance was to the eldeſt ſonne; For <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaking of the German Cavalry, ſaith, that the horſe of the party dead went not to the eldeſt ſonne <hi>ut cetera,</hi> but to the moſt valiant man amongſt them of that linage; which words <hi>ut cetera</hi> doe plainly intimate, that other matters of profit paſſed to the eldeſt ſonne in point of deſcent; Nor can I conceive how men ſhould be induced to conceit that the cuſtome of Gavelkind was the ancient generall cuſtome of the Germans. Its true the words of the ſame Hiſtorian have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome; the words are, <hi>Haeredes tamen &amp; ſucceſſores cuique Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri;</hi> theſe taken collectively I grant may import ſomewhat tending that way; but they may as properly be taken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively, that the children inherite by courſe; and if none ſuch were, then the brothers; if they failed, then the unkles. And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:152542:71"/> its not onely evident that in the publique ſucceſſion to the Crown they had an eye this way; but in the deſcent of private and particular eſtates, as by many inſtances out of thoſe old Hiſtories may appeare; and had any other cuſtome been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>Alfreds</hi> rule by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law had never ſucceeded; nor could that other cuſtome hold out againſt the conſtant deſire of the Saxons to perpetuate their families in greatneſſe and honour: all which beſides the expreſſe laws ſet forth in the Codes, are in my conceit ſufficient to induce an hiſtoricall faith that the generall courſe of deſcent was to the eldeſt ſons, and not to all joyntly. Nevertheleſſe out of this eſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance divers particular eſtates were created, as well by common cuſtome, as by the eſpeciall act of the owner of ſuch eſtate. Such of them as were wrought by cuſtome was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned from marriage, whereby if the man was ſetled of ſuch eſtate as formerly hath been recited, and died;<note place="margin">Dower.</note> his wife ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by ancient cuſtome ſhe had her dower or third part of ſuch eſtate of inheritance. This cuſtome though ancient, yet was not originally from the Germans, but from the Latines, who uſed to give dower with the man,<note place="margin">Plut. vit. Solon. Apotheg. Lacon.</note> and receive portion with the woman. But the Germans learned from the Greeks otherwiſe; for the Laws both of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> forbad the latter, leſt marriages ſhould be made for reward, and not grounded upon affection; which, as they conceived, would be a means to maintaine the ſtrength of mankind in generation. And therefore <hi>Tacitus</hi> noteth this by way of Antitheſis <hi>Dotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non uxor marito ſed uxori maritus offert.</hi> The dower that was given in the firſt times was goods; and theſe were utenſiles for warre. And the wife many times returned to the man tokens of her love in the ſame kind, and not as gages of future mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, unleſſe we ſhall account warre their proper calling from whence their livelihood iſſued. Succeeding times grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more calme changed the cuſtome of fighting into trading, and taught them to preferre the ſtock gotten by commerce, before that of warre, and ſo the dower was changed. This courſe continued all the Saxons time, for ought I can finde; for not much above threeſcore yeeres before the conqueſt it was by a publique law confirmed,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. Lamb. Edm. fo. 76.</note> that the Bridegroome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152542:72"/> marriage ſhould ſet forth that portion of goods that ſhould be his wifes,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. 50. Reg. 22.</note> and theſe were ever afterward holden her own proper goods. But if no ſuch proviſion was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage, then the law or cuſtome gave the wife halfe her husbands goods, if ſhe outlived him; and if there were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then the whole eſtate in goods, to provide for her ſelfe and them, untill ſhe tooke a ſecond husband; but if the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſuffered death as a malefactor, the wife was to have but one third part.<note place="margin">Ll Sax. Lam. fo. 14. Ll. Inae cap. 58</note> I finde no footſteps of Dower in Lands untill the Normans time; who were alſo as well owners of the wifes perſonall eſtate, as of their perſons; and before which time the Saxon wives in divers regards were more abſolute and independant: I ſay not more happy, becauſe they were never one with their husbands; nor were they ever under the Law of free pledge, as wives; nor was the husband his wifes pledge as he was her husband; although as a maſter he was free pledge for his ſervants: for the Law was, that in caſe the husband car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his wife away into another Lordſhip,<note place="margin">Ll. Edm. Lamb cap. 7.</note> as he muſt give pledges that his wife ſhall have no wrong, ſo ſhe muſt give pledge by her friends that ſhe ſhall do no wrong; and ſhe paſſed therefore as an appurtenant to her husband, then in unity with him; and her eſtate or portion was rather appurtenant to her then him: for if ſhe failed in her good carriage to her husband, ſhe was to make amends out of her own eſtate to her husband; and if her eſtate ſufficed not, then her pledges were to ſatisfie the husband.<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. 50. Reg. 22.</note> Nevertheleſſe what failed in the relation of the woman to the man, was ſupplied in the relation of the man to the woman; for beſides the reſpect the men bare to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as their wives, they honoured them as German women, that admired valour in all, Idolized it in their husbands, and ſhared in it themſelves; and upon occaſion merited thereby not onely to be companions in honour, but triumphers above men, ye their Commanders and governours: Nor was this the originall trick of the rude and uncompt Germans or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Britons, but of the wiſe Greeks; and received as may be ſuppoſed from the Lacedemonians, upon as good ground as the wiſe of <hi>Leonidas</hi> the Lacedemonian King rendred, who being asked why the Lacedemonian women ruled their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152542:72"/> Its true, ſaid ſhe,<note place="margin">Curteſie of England.</note> for we onely know how to obey our husbands. A ſecond particular eſtate, which the Law derived out of the inheritance, was advancement to the husband; for the Saxons were not ſo ſtupid as to refuce favour profer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and therefore they made a law of Counter-tenure to that of Dower which we commonly call tenure by the curteſie of <hi>England;</hi> which was but a perquiſite of the wives eſtate given to the husband, in caſe he over lived his wife, and had iſſue by her born alive: The name was probably given by the Normans, who as it ſeemeth had no ſuch cuſtome; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave it the name from the Engliſh (albeit ſince that time <hi>Scotland</hi> hath alſo allowed it amongſt them) who might probably bring it into this Kingdome or Country amongſt the mingled people;<note place="margin">Ll.

               <p>Eſtates that were derived out of the eſtate of an inheritance by the act of the party,<note place="margin">Eſtate taile.</note> either were ſuch as concerned the whole inheritance, or part thereof. That which concerned the whole inheritance, was nothing but a parcelling of it out according to the will of the giver; and this was afterwards called eſtate Taile, which paſſed alſo amongſt ſome places by way of cuſtome,<note place="margin">Ll. Ang. tit 6. Lindenbr.</note> as amongſt the Angles it was a law that the inheritance ſhould paſſe unto the iſſue males on the fathers ſide, untill the fifth generation, before any title could accrew to the iſſue female; and then according to their Proverbe, it went from the Lance to the Spindle. But the Danes poſſibly might prevent this in the continuance thereof; for they brought along with them that which was formerly the Saxon cuſtome,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. tit. 7. ibid. Concil. Brit. 333.</note> which carried the inheritance unto the daughters, upon the failing of the iſſue male: as in the example of <hi>Cenedritha</hi> daughter to <hi>Cenulfus</hi> amongſt multitudes of others may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.<note place="margin">Ll. Alured. Sax. c. 7.</note> But where Lands were conveyed by writing or act of the party, it was a maxime that the will of the conveyor ſhould
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152542:73"/> be ſtrictly obſerved: nor could ever any one that came in by vertue of ſuch writing ever alien the Land to croſſe the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the originall conveyance. The entailing of eſtates therefore was very ancient,<note place="margin">Plo. com. 251. b.</note> although by corrupt cuſtome it was deluded, as the Lord <hi>Dier</hi> in his argument of the L. <hi>Berklies</hi> caſe obſerveth.</p>
               <p>Another cuſtome of inheritance was catcht I know not how, its called Burrough Engliſh, and by the name may ſeem to be brought in by ſome Cynicall odde Angle that meant to croſſe the world, and yet in a way not contrary to all reaſon: for where nature affords leaſt helpe, the wiſdome of men hath uſed to be moſt carefull of ſupply; and thus the youngeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came preferred before the elder in the courſe of deſcent of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance according to this cuſtome. There is no further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of the antiquity hereof that I have met with, then the name it ſelfe, which importeth that it ſprang up whiles as yet the names of Angles and Saxons held in comon cogniſance: &amp; might ariſe firſt from the grant of the Lords to their Tenants, and ſo by continuance become uſuall; and by this means alſo might ariſe the cuſtome of Copyholds of this nature ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, eſpecially in thoſe Eaſtern parts of this Iſland where the Angles ſetled, and from whom that part had the name of the Eaſt Angles.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gavel kind.</note>Another cuſtome of deſcent remaineth, and that is to the children collectively, and its called Gavell kind, or Gave-all kind: and by the very name ſeemeth at the firſt to ariſe rather from the donation of the parent or other anceſtor, contrary to common cuſtome, then by common Law: otherwiſe no need had been of an eſpeciall name. In the originall it ſeems it equally concerned all both ſonnes and daughters, as parceners; and for want of ſuch, the brothers and ſiſters. It ſeemeth to be firſt the Law of the Goths or Jutes;<note place="margin">Stephanus Dan. Burcus Suel.</note> for it remaineth in uſe in theſe parts of the Eaſterne Countries. But in later times this eſtate was alſo tailed, or cut out ſometimes to the ſonnes and daughters ſeverally; that is, the ſonnes or brothers to have two parts, and the daughters or ſiſters one part; other times to all the ſonnes, and for want of ſuch, to all the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and thus theſe courſes of eſtates paſſed over Seas to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152542:73"/> Southern parts of this Iſland where that people moſt ſetled in a double ſtream; the firſt from the Athenians that loved the ſtatelineſſe of their families, the other from the Lacedemonians who deſired rather the continuance of their familes then their greatneſſe.<note place="margin">Emmius. Grec.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The manner of conveying of eſtates between party and party was either by act of the party executed in his life time,<note place="margin">Conveyances in writing.</note> or after his death: ſuch as were executed in the lifetime of the owner, and were ſuch as for the moſt part were in matters of great moment, were eſtates paſſing by deed of conveyance in writing: and for this way the Saxons were beholding to the Latines, who taught them that courſe,<note place="margin">Ll.

The nature of the conveyances in theſe ancient times may appear by a deed of the Kings of this Iſland about 400 yeeres before the Conqueſt, whereby he granted foure plough lands in the Iſle of <hi>Tenet</hi> unto an Abbeſſe; wherin inſtead of that which we now call the <hi>habendum,</hi>

               <p>SUch like as hath been ſhewed was the courſe of government in thoſe darker times; nor did the fundamentals alter either by the diverſity and mixture of people of ſeverall Nations in the firſt entrance, nor from the Danes or Normans in their ſurvenue; not onely becauſe in their originall they all brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed one ayre of the laws and government of <hi>Greece,</hi> but alſo they were no other then common dictates of nature refined by wiſe men, which challenge a kind of awe in the ſence of the moſt barbarous. I had almoſt forgot one circumſtance, which tended much to the honour of all the reſt, that is their ſpeedy execution of juſtice; for they admitted no delaies till upon experience they found that by ſtaying a little longer they had done the ſooner: and this brought forth particular times of exemption,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 4. Sec. 16.</note> as that of infancy and child-bearing, in caſe of anſwer to criminail accuſations. But more eſpecially in caſe of regard of holineſſe of the time: as that of the Lords day, Saints daies,<note place="margin">Ll. Sax. cap. 10. Concil. Brit. 518.</note> Faſts, Ember daies; for even thoſe daies were had in much honour. Nor onely daies, but ſeaſons: as from Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to the Octaves of Epiphany; from Septuageſima till fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen daies after Eaſter, or (as by the Laws of the Confeſſor) till eight daies after Eaſter; and from Aſcention to the eighth day after Pentecoſt; and though as Kings and times did change, ſo theſe ſeaſons might be diverſly cut out; as the Laws of <hi>Alfred, Aethelſtan, Aetheldred, Edgar, Canutus,</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; yet all agreed in the ſeaſon of the yeere, and that ſome were more fit for holy obſervation then others. And thus by the devotion of Princes, and power of the Clergy, the foure Terms of the yeere were cut out for courſe of law in the Kings Court, the reſt of the yeere being left vacant for the exerciſe and maintenance of Husbandry, and particular callings and imployments, ſaving that even in thoſe times the Courts of the County and Hundred held their ancient and conſtant

               <p>ANd thus farre of the joynts of Saxon government in their perſons, precincts, courts, cauſes, and laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as the diſtance will permit, and according to my capacity I have endeavoured to refreſh the Image of the Saxon Common-weale; the more curious lineaments being now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by time; afarre off it ſeems a Monarchy, but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach diſcovers more of a Democracy; and if the temper of a body may appeare by the prevailing humour towards age, that government did ſtill appeare more prevalent in all aſſaults both of time and change. The firſt great change it felt was from the Danes that ſtormed them, and ſhewed therein much of the wrath both of God and man. And yet it trenched not upon the fundamentall law of the peoples liberty. The worſt effect it had was upon the Church in the decay of the power of Religion and worſhip of God. For after much toile and loſſe both of ſweat and blood, the Danes (finding that little was to be gotten by blows but blows: and that the Clergy at the leaſt was the ſide-wind in the courſe of all affaires) laid aſide their Paganiſme, and joyned with the Clergy; and as their converts and pupils gained not onely their quiet reſidence, but the favour of the Clergy to make triall of the Throne, and therein ſerved the Clergy ſo well as they brought the people to a perfect Idolatry, with times, places, and perſons, and ſubjection of their eſtates to Church tributes. And as at Tenis the Dane and Biſhop ſerved each
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152542:76"/> other with the fond Countrey man, that whether Lord Dane or Lord Biſhop was the greater burden, is hard to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Thus became ambicious Prelacy in its full glory, and the poore Church of Chriſt clouded in darkneſſe, and little hold left for recovery, but onely by the liberty of the Saxon freeman; which the Danes could never conquer, not for want of will or power, but of time and occaſion; for the Crown returned to the Saxon line againe after the halfe age of one man, although it was worn by three; ſo God would have it; nor did any monument of the Daniſh government remain, ſaving a few cuſtomes in ſome places which ſhew rather that the Danes were there then ruled here.</p>
               <p>To ſumme up all. The Saxon Commonweale was a building of greateſt ſtrength downward even to the foundation, arched together both for peace and warre, That by the law of Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wherein Juſtice was the bond, this by their armies ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, not by promiſcuous flocking of people, but by orderly concurrance of families,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> kindreds, and Decenners, all choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their own leaders; and ſo honour, love, and truſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to leave no mans life in danger, nor death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenged.</p>
               <p>It was a beautifull compoſure, mutually dependant in every part from the Crown to the cloune, the Magiſtrates being all choice men, and the King the choiceſt of choſen; election being the birth of eſteem, and that of merit; this bred love and mutuall truſt, which made them as corner-ſtones, pointed forward to breake the wave of danger; nor was other reward expected by the great men, but honour and admiration, which commonly brought a return of acts of renown</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it was a regular frame, in every part ſquared and made even by Lawes, which in the people ruled as <hi>lex loquens,</hi> and in the Magiſtrate as <hi>lex intelligens;</hi> all of them being grounded on the wiſdome of the Greekes and Judicials of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus the Saxons became ſomewhat like the Jewes, divers from all other people; their lawes honourable for the King, eaſie for the ſubject; and their government above all other likeſt unto that of Chriſts Kingdome, whoſe yoke is eaſie, and burthen light: but their motion proved ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:152542:76"/> irregular as God was pleaſed to reduce them by another way.</p>

               <p>THus was <hi>England</hi> become a goodly Farme; The Britons were the owners, the Saxons the occupants, having no better title then a poſſeſſion upon a forcible entry, with a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuando</hi> for the ſpace of foure hundred yeares, ſeldome quiet, either from the claime and diſturbances of the reſtleſſe Britons, or invading Danes, who not onely got footing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but ſetled in the Throne; and after gave over the ſame to the uſe (as it proved) of another people ſprung from the wilde ſtock of <hi>Norway,</hi> and thence tranſplanted into a milder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, yet ſcarcely civillized; that in one Iſle the glory of Gods bounty might ſhine forth to all the barbariſme of Europe in making a beautifull Church out of the refuſe of Nations. Theſe were the Normans out of the continent of <hi>France,</hi> that in their firſt view appeared like the pillar of the cloud with terrour of revenge upon the Daniſh pride, the Saxon cruelty, and Idolatry of both peoples; but after ſome diſtance ſhewed like the pillar of fire, clearing Gods providence for the good of this Iſland, to be enjoyed by the ſucceeding generations. Nor was this done by revelation or viſion, but by over-ruling the aſpiring mind of Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> to be a ſcourge unto <hi>Harold</hi> for his uſurpation, and unto the people for their cauſeleſſe deſerting the royall ſtemme: yet becauſe the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt ſpirit is ſtill under fame and opinion, and cannot reſt without pretence or colour of right and juſtice, the Duke firſt armed himſelfe with titles, which were too many to make one good claime; and ſerved rather to buſie mens minds with muſing, whiles he catcheth the prey, then ſettle their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in approving of his way. Firſt, he was couſin german to the Confeſſor, and he childleſſe: and thus the Duke was nigh, though there were nigher then he; but the worſt point
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152542:77"/> in the caſe was that the Duke was a baſtard, and ſo by the Saxon law without the line; nor was there other ſalve thereto but the Norman cuſtome, that made no difference; ſo as the Duke had a colour to frame a title, though <hi>England</hi> had no Law to allow it; and this was the beſt flower of his Garland, when he meant to ſolace himſelfe with the Engliſh, as may appeare by what his ſonne <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt ſets forth to the world in his charter whereby he advanced the Abby of Ely into the degree of a Biſhoprick, and wherein amongſt his other titles he cals himſelfe ſonne of <hi>William</hi> the great,<note place="margin">Spicileg.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui Edwardo Regi ſucceſſit in regnum jure haereditario.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if that came ſhort, he had the bequeſt of the Confeſſor, who had deſigned the Duke to be his ſucceſſor; and this was confirmed by the conſent of the Nobility, and principally of <hi>Harold</hi> himſelfe,<note place="margin">M. Paris. 1. An. Brit. Eccleſ. 96.</note> and in aſſurance thereof promiſed his ſiſter to the Duke in marriage. This countenanced a double title, one by legacy, the other by election, and might be ſufficient if not to make the Dukes title juſt; yet <hi>Harold's</hi> the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and to ground that quarrell that in the concluſion laid the Dukes way open to the Crown: And for the better varniſh the Duke would not be his own judge, he referres his Title to be diſcuſſed at the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo flattered the Pope with a judicatory power amongſt Princes (a trick of the new ſtamp) whereby he obtained ſentence in his own behalfe from the infallible chaire: The Pope glad hereof laid up this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his treaſures as an eſtoppell to Kings for times to come; And the King made no leſſe benefit of eſtoppel againſt the Engliſh Clergy that otherwiſe might have oppoſed him, and of aſſurance of thoſe to him that were his friends, and of advantage againſt <hi>Harold</hi> that had gotten the Crown <hi>ſine Eccleſiaſtica authoritate</hi> and by that meanes had made Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> and all the Prelates of <hi>England</hi> his enemies.<note place="margin">M. Paris: 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But if all failed, yet the Duke had now a juſt cauſe of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againſt <hi>Harold</hi> for breach of oath and covenant,<note place="margin">Hiſt. vit. Eadm. 5.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if <hi>Harold</hi> chanced to be vanquiſhed, and the Crown offered it ſelfe faire; he might without breach of conſcience or modeſty accept thereof and be accounted happy in the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and wiſe in the receiving, rather then unjuſtly hardy in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152542:77"/> the forcing thereof. And this might occaſion the Duke to challenge <hi>Harold</hi> to ſingle combate, as if he would let all the world know that the quarrell was perſonall, and not Nationall.</p>
               <p>But this maske ſoon fell off by the death of <hi>Harold,</hi> and the Duke muſt now explaine himſelfe, that it was the value of the Engliſh Crown, and not the title that brought him over. For though he might ſeem as it were in the heat of the chaſe to be drawn to <hi>London,</hi> where the Crown was, and that he rather ſought after his enemies then it; yet as ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Crown in his power, he diſputed not the right, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that was <hi>Edgars,</hi> but poſſeſſed himſelfe of the long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired prey: and yet he did it in a mannerly way, as if he ſaw in it ſomewhat more then Gold and precious ſtones: for though he might have taken it by raviſhment, yet he choſe the way of wooing by a kind of mutuall agreement. Thus this mighty Conquerour ſuffered himſelfe to be conquered, and ſtooping under the law of a Saxon King he became a King by leave: wiſely foreſeeing that a title gotten by election is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine then that which is gotten by power.</p>

               <p>SOme there are that build their opinion upon paſſionate notes of angry writers, and doe conclude that the Dukes way and title was wholy by conqueſt, and thence inferre ſtrange aphoriſmes of ſtate deſtructive to the government of this Kingdome.

               <p>It will eaſily be granted that the title of conqueſt was never further then the Kings thoughts, if it ever entered therein; elſe wherefore did he pretend other titles to the world? But becauſe it may be thought that his wiſdome would not ſuffer him to pretend what he intended, and yet in practice intended
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152542:78"/> not at what he did pretend: it will be the skill of the Reader to conſider the manner of the firſt <hi>William's</hi> Coronation, and his ſucceeding government. His Coronation queſtionleſſe was the ſame with that of the Ancient Saxon Kings; for he was crowned in the Abbey of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> becauſe he of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was not Canonicall.

The people alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Covenant with him, That as well within the Land as without they would be faithfull to their Lord King <hi>William,</hi> and in every place to keepe with all fidelity his Lands and Honours, together with him, and againſt enemies and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to defend. It is the ſelfeſame in ſubſtance with the fealty that the Saxons made to their Kings, as will appeare by the paralelling them both together. The Saxons were ſworn to defend the Kingdome againſt ſtrangers and enemies, together with their Lord the King, and to preſerve his Lands and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours together with him with all faithfulneſſe; ſo as by the Saxon way the allegiance firſt terminated on the Kingdome, and then as in order thereunto upon the King, with his Lands and honours: but the Norman either wholly omitted the firſt as needleſſe to be inſerted in a municipall Law, it ſelfe being a Law in nature; or elſe includeth all within the words Lands and Honours, taking the ſame in a comprehenſive ſence for the whole Kindome, and ſo made up the ſumme of the Saxon fealty in fewer figures. Which may ſeem the more probable of the twaine, becauſe little reaſon can be rendred why the King ſhould reſtraine that defence to his private lands (if he clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all by conqueſt) when as all equally concerned him; or why he ſhould exclude the publique, when as both himſelfe and all he had was imbarked therein, and it might ſubſiſt without him, but contrarily not he without it, appeareth not to my underſtanding; nor did the thing enter into the Kings purpoſe, if the file of his purpoſes be rightly conſidered: For ſpeaking concerning Caſtles, Burroughs, and Cities,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:152542:78"/> which are in nature of limmes of the Common-weale he ſaith that they were built for the defence of the people and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; was this the ſervice of walls and fortifications,<note place="margin">Ll.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the plain Engliſh is, that in time of breach of publique quiet and peace, the ſubiects were bound to defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in order thereto the people of the ſame, and of the Kings right included in the publique defence; elſe it were a ſtrange concluſion, that each man in particular, and in their own perſon alone was bound to defend the Kings right; but being imbodied, the Kingdome. And yet more clearly its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in that the ſervice of the order of Knighthood which was the chiefe ſtrength of the Nation in thoſe daies, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon the ſervice of the King,<note place="margin">M.

To defend the Kingdom with their lives and fortunes againſt all enemies, to the utmoſt of their power. 2. To keepe the peace and dignities of the Crown. 3. To maintaine right and juſtice by all means, without deceipt and delay. Joyn then theſe two oathes together, <hi>viz.</hi> that of fealty, and this of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; and it will eaſily appeare, that the allegiance of the Engliſh to the Norman Kings was no other then what might ſtand with brotherhood, and tender regard of the publique above all: and differing from the Saxon fealty onely in this that that was in one oath, &amp; this in two. Wherefore whatſoever reſpects ſteered in the reare of the Kings courſe its leſſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſo long as the vanne was right, albeit that the ſequell will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152542:79"/> prove not much different from the premiſes, as will appeare in the foot of the whole account.</p>
               <p>Thus entered the firſt Norman upon the Saxon Throne: and as he had ſome colour of right to countenance his courſe,<note place="margin">William Rufus.</note> ſo had his ſonne his fathers laſt will, and yet he had as little right as he. This was <hi>William Rufus</hi> that was of his fathers way, but of a deeper die; and therefore might well be called <hi>William Rufus,</hi> or <hi>William</hi> in grain. He was exceeding happy in the feare or favour of the people, for he had nothing elſe to make room for his riſing. True it is he had the good will of his father, but he was dead, and probably the people as little regarded it as he did them. Nor was it ever obſerved that the Engliſh Crown was of ſo light account, as to paſſe by deviſe of <hi>ceſtui que uſe;</hi> and therefore though it was deſigned to him from his father, yet both right and poſſeſſion was left to the people to determine and maintaine. The Clergy firſt led the way,<note place="margin">Eadmer. hiſt. Wigorn. M. Paris.</note> having fiſt taken a recogniſance of him for his good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour towards them, which he aſſured as farre as large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and proteſtations would ſerve the turne: and within one yeere after, ſtanding in need of the favour of the Commons (to maintaine poſſeſſion againſt his brother <hi>Robert</hi>) he gave them as good ſecurity as the Clergy had; which he kept in ſuch manner, that it was a wonder that one of ſo ſmall intereſt in the Title, but what he had by the peoples leave and favour, ſhould rule in ſuch manner, and yet die a King: The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the people being like a meteor that muſt be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fed, or it ſoon goes out and fals: for evident it is that the right of inheritance was his elder brother <hi>Roberts,</hi> who was the braver man, and more experienced ſouldier; and upon theſe principles had obtained the love of the Norman Barons (the flower of his fathers chivalry;<note place="margin">M.

Its true the Engliſh ſtooke cloſe to him; but how they were gained or contained, writers ſpeake not, but tell us of his promiſes, which alſo they tell us were vaine,

For that capitulation was in ſubſtance ſetled by the ancient laws of the Saxons mixed with ſome additions of laws made by the Kings father, with the joynt advice of the grand Councell of the Kingdom; all which both the Norman <hi>Williams</hi> had often cofirmed by ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and promiſes, however their actions upon ſudden ſurpriſall were <hi>malae conſuetudines</hi> and <hi>exactiones injuſtae,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVI.</hi> That the government of the Normans proceeded upon the Saxon principles, and firſt of Parliaments.</head>
               <p>THe principles which I mean, are theſe: Firſt, the legiſlative power and influence thereof upon the whole. Secondly, the members of that government, with their ſeverall motions. Thirdly, the laws &amp; cuſtoms or rules of thoſe motions: and firſt concerning the legiſlative power. Although it be true that the firſt <hi>Williams</hi> great and moſt conſtant labour was to have and to hold and had but little time or liberty to enjoy, yet that time of reſt which had, he did apply it and himſelfe in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Laws by advice of Common-councell; I ſay, not by advice of his own heart or two or three Norman Lords, or of the Norman Nobility onely, as ſome men take the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to averre, as if they had been eye-witneſſes to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe daies: but by the joynt adviſe of the grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Lords and wiſe men of the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spicileg. p. 5.</note> I will not inſiſt upon force of argument to ſhew that common reaſon muſt of neceſſity ſway the King into this courſe, but ſhall reſerve that to another place; the teſtimonies of Writers muſt now ſerve the turn; and herein the teſtimony of the Chronicle of <hi>Leichfield</hi> muſt have the firſt place, which ſpeaks both of a Councell of Lords, and ſaith that by their advice he cauſed to be ſummoned a meeting of all the Nobles and wiſe men through all the Counties of <hi>England,</hi> to ſet downe their laws and cuſtomes. This was in the fourth yeere of his reigne, or rather after his entry; and as ſoon as the Kingdome was brought into any reaſonable poſture of quiet; and which beſides the intention of governing the Kingdome according unto Law doth ſtrongly pretend that the Parliament had the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152542:80"/> legiſlative power and right of cogniſance, and judicature in thoſe laws that concerned the Kingdome in generall; and for the particular laws or cuſtomes of ſeverall places or precincts, it was referred to a Committee or Jury in every County to ſet them forth upon oath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this Councell had power to change laws may likewiſe appeare in that act made concerning the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Canon law,<note place="margin">Spicil. 167. Fox. Mart. l. 4.</note> which ſhewes not onely the power of that Councell in Church-matters, but alſo that the Canon was no further in force then the ſame would allow; and this was alſo done by the Common councell, and the Councell of the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, and all the Princes of the Kingdome; which connection ſhews plainly that there was Councell beſides that of the Prelates and Princes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in matters of generall charge upon the whole body of the people the King uſed alſo the helpe of this grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 58. Spicil.</note> as may eſpecially appeare in the charge of armes impoſed upon the ſubjects; its ſaid it was done by the Common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the whole Kingdome; as is witneſſed even by the Kings own law. It may ſeem alſo that the grand Officers of the ſtate were elected by ſuch grand aſſemblie of the wiſe men; for we finde that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> was elected to the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by the aſſent of the Lords and Prelates, and of the whole people,<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. fo. 110.</note> that is, by the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> and as probable it is that Biſhops were therein alſo elected, for that the Biſhop of <hi>Liechfield</hi> reſigned his Biſhoprick in ſuch like aſſembly, if the meaning of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> be rightly underſtood,<note place="margin">Baron. Anal. An. 1070.</note> who ſaith in his letter that it was in <hi>conventu Epiſcoporum atque Laicorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, that one Law of this Kings which may be called the firſt <hi>Magna charta</hi> in the Norman times, by which the King reſerved to himſelfe from the free men of this Kingdome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their free ſervice,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 55.</note> in the concluſion ſaith that their Lands were thus granted to them in inheritance of the King by the Common councell of the whole Kingdome, and ſo aſſerts in one the liberty of the free men, and of the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative body of the Kingdome. Theſe footſteps of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment finde we in the Conquerours time, beſides other more generall intimations ſcattered amongſt the Hiſtorians, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152542:81"/> may induce opinion to its full ſtrength, that this King how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Conquerour he was, yet made uſe of this additionall power of Parliament to perfect his deſignes, and it may be more often then either of his ſonnes that yet had leſſe pretence of ſuperlative power to countenance their proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Rufus</hi> was a man of reſolution no whit inferiour, if not ſurpaſſing his father, and had wit enough for any thing but to govern his deſires, which led him many times wilde, and might occaſion conceit that he was almoſt a mad King, though he were a witty man; &amp; therefore its the leſſe marvell if he uſed not the help of the Common councell more then needs muſt; where Kings many times are told of that which they are loth to know. Nevertheleſſe <hi>William</hi> the ſecond could not paſſe over thirteen yeeres without a parley with his Commons and Clergy; unleſſe he meant to adventure a parley between them and his brother <hi>Robert,</hi> who like an Eagle eyed his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, though he hovered afar of.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt was more wiſe, and being trained up even from the Cradle in the Engliſh garb, moralized by learning, and now admitted into the Throne, found it the wiſeſt courſe to apply himſelfe to the rule of an Engliſh King, <hi>viz.</hi> to winne and maintaine the good opinion of the people by conſorting together with them under one Law, and pledging himſelfe thereto by taking unto wife one of the Engliſh blood-royall; by this meanes reſeiſed and reaſſumed the Engliſh in partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Norman in their ancient right of government; and reconciled the minds of the people under a lively hope of enjoying a ſetled government. Nor were they greatly deceived herein; for his courſe was leſſe plannetary then that of either of his predeceſſors, and yet we finde little ſaid of his parley with his people in a Parliamentary way, although more of his laws then of any of his predeceſſors. The reaſon will reſt in this, that the writers of thoſe times touch more upon matters of ordinary then politicall obſervation, and regarded rather the thing then the place or manner how. The Lawes therefore although they are not intituled as made in Parliament, yet in the continuation of the Hiſtory of <hi>Bede</hi> its noted that the King renewed or confirmed the ancient Laws
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152542:81"/> in <hi>Concilio peritorum &amp; proborum virorum regni Angliae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bede hiſt. l. 3. c. 30.</note> which may give ſufficient cauſe to ſuppoſe that he declined not the ancient way no more then he did the ancient Law.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVII.</hi> Of the Franchiſe of the Church in the Normans time.</head>
               <p>THe Canon law that ever ſince <hi>Auſtins</hi> comming like Thunder rumbled in the cloud, now breaks forth with confuſion to all oppoſers. It had formerly made many faire proffers of ſervice to this Iſland, but it was diſaccepted as too ſtately to ſerve, yet by often curteſies received it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as a friend a farre of. For the vaſt body of the Roman Empire like a body waſting with age, died upward, and left the Britons to their own Laws before the ſecond beaſt was grown, which being young was nouriſhed under the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Law of the firſt beaſt, till it grew as ſtrong as its damme, and began to prey for it ſelfe. The Empire perceiving its gray haires, and the youthfull courage of this upſtart, was glad to enter mutuall league with it, the one to maintain the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Monarchy of the other, and that the Imperiall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the former; and ſo became the Canon and Imperiall Law to be united, and the profeſſours to be <hi>utriuſque juris.</hi> But this parity continued not long; the young beaſt looked like a Lamb, but ſpake like a Lyon; and contrarily the Eagle had caſt its feathers and could towre no more; ſo as by this time the Pope was too good for the Emperour and the Canon law above the Imperiall; yet allowing it to ſerve the turne: and ſo the profeſſors of both Laws became ſtudents in the Civill but practiſers of the Canon. This compoſition thus made beyond the Seas, the great worke was how to tranſport it over into this Iſle: for the Emperours could intitle the Pope to no power here, becauſe none he had. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the worke; he offers it to the Britons under the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly title of Univerſall Biſhop: but they kept themſelves out
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:152542:82"/> of Canon-ſhot. The Saxons allowed the title, but liked not the power. The Monk obſerved the ſtop, and left time to work out that which preſent cunning could not, being content for the preſent that a league of cohabitation ſhould be made between the two Swords,<note place="margin">Ll. Edw. c. 3.</note> though the ſpirituall were for the preſent underling, not diſpairing that it would worke out its owne way over the Saxon law, as it had done over the Imperiall. Nor did his conceit altogether faile; for the Saxons by little allowed much, and the Danes more; although the main was preſerved untill the Normans came upon the ſtage, who made their way by the Popes leave, and gave him a colour of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then ever any of their Saxon predeceſſors had done; and to gaine the more quiet poſſeſſion of the Crown to themſelves, allowed the Pope the honour of their Councell, learned to draw the conveyance; which as ſome thinke was made advantagiouſly for the Pope himſelfe in point of tenure, but more probably in the covenants. For the Conquerour was ſcarce ſetled in his ſeat, but the Canon law began to ſpeak in the voyce of a Royall law:<note place="margin">Spicil. 167. Fox Mart. l. 4.</note> Firſt, complaining of miſ-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if the Church were extreamly wronged by having the ſame way and law of triall with the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> and then propounds foure ſeverall expedients, enough to have undone the whole Common-weale in the very entrance; had not the ſuperſtition of thoſe times blinded both Parliament and people, and rendered them willing with that which their ſucceſſors in future ages often repented of.</p>
               <p>No offence againſt the Biſhops Laws ſhall be handled in the Hundred.</p>
               <p>By the Saxon law Church matters had the preheminence both in the Hundred, and in the County; and it was the Biſhops duty to joyn with the Sheriff in thoſe Courts, to direct and ſee to the adminiſtration of juſtice: and yet the Canon had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred yeeres foregoing in the negative.</p>
               <p>No caſe concerning the Regiment of ſoules ſhall be brought before the ſecular Judge.</p>
               <p>The Regiment of ſoules was a common place ſufficient to containe any thing that was in order thereunto: and ſo every one that hath a ſoule muſt be no more reſponſall unto the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:152542:82"/> temporall Judge for any matter concerning it, but unto the Eccleſiaſticall power; and this not onely in caſe of ſcandall, as againſt the morall law or rule of faith, but for diſobedience done to the Canons, made afar off, concerning any geſture or garbe that may come within the ſavour of an Eccleſiaſticall conceit.</p>
               <p>That all delinquents againſt the Biſhops laws ſhall anſwer the fact in a place appointed by the Biſhop to that end.</p>
               <p>So as now the Biſhop hath gotten a Court by the Statute law, that had formerly no other Cards to ſhew but that of the Canon, and a Court of ſuch place as the Biſhop ſhall appoint, however inconvenient for diſtance or uncertainty it be.</p>
               <p>That the triall of ſuch matters ſhall be according to the law of the Canon, and not according to that of the Hundred.</p>
               <p>That is, not by Jury, but by witneſſes, in a clandeſtine way if the Biſhop pleaſe, or without any accuſer, or by more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, or any other way that may reſerve the Lay man to the breaſt of a prepoſſeſſed ſpirit of the ſpirituall Judge. And thus the poore Countreyman is expoſed to the cenſure of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known law in an unknown tongue, by an unknown way; wherein they had no footing but by an implicite faith: And herein the providence of God (I imagine) was more manifeſt then the wiſdome of man, which was too weake to foreſee events at ſo great a diſtance; For queſtionleſſe it was a point of excellent wiſdome for the people (now under a King of a rugged nature that would not ſticke to catch whatſoever he could get) to depoſite part of their liberties into the hands of the Clergy; from whom moderation might be expected as from friends and neighbours, and (as partners in one ſhip) mutuall engagement to withſtand the waves of prerogative of Kings that ſeldome reſts till it breaks all banks, and ſometimes over-reaches its own guard, and cannot return when it would. And thus it fell out; for many times the Pope and Clergy became protectors of the peoples liberties, and kept them ſafe from the rage of Kings, untill the time of reſtitution ſhould come; and became not onely a wall of defence to the one, but a rock of offence to the other. For the Tripple Crown could never ſolder with the Engliſh, nor it with that; the ſtrife was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152542:83"/> for prerogative, wherein if the Clergy gained, the Crown loſt, and no moderation would be allowed. For the conquering King was ſcarce warm in his Throne when as the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded fealty of him for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spicil. 164 Baronus Anal. An, 1068.</note> and the Kings own good Archbiſhop and friend <hi>Lanfranke</hi> delivered the meſſage; as alſo <hi>Anſelme</hi> did afterwards to <hi>William Rufus,</hi> which though Kings had courage enough to deny, yet it ſhewed plainly that the Popes meaned no leſſe game then Crown-glieke with the King and people, the Archbiſhops and Biſhops holding the Cards for the Pope, while in the interim he overſaw all. The Norman Kings thus braved, payd the Popes in their own Coyne, and refuſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Pope but ſuch as are firſt allowed by their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.<note place="margin">Edmer. hiſt. l. 1. p. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we the ſecond bravado of the Canon Law; for as yet it was not ſo fully entered, as it ſeemed. The words of the act of Parliament its true were generall; yet their ſence was left to time to expound, and the courſe of ſucceeding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires nevertheleſſe paſſed with a <hi>non obſtante.</hi> For whereas in thoſe daies the Clergy claimed both legiſlative and executory power in Church matters, the Normans would allow of neither, but claimed both as of right belonging to the Imperiall power of this Iſland, originally and onely. As touching the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, its evident that notwithſtanding the Canon that had long before this time voted the Laity from having to doe with Church matters; yet the Norman Kings would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow to the Metropolitans the power of calling Synods nor ſuch meetings,<note place="margin">Edmer. hiſt. p. 6. &amp; 24. Spicil. 163.</note> but by their leave, although it was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contended for. Neither could the Clergy prevaile to exclude the Laity out of their Synods, being aſſembled, nor from their wonted priviledge of voting therein; albeit that for a long time by Canon it had been contradicted. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Clergy and the Kings concerning theſe and other matters grew ſo hot, that Kings liked not to have any Synods or meetings of publique Councell;<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Paſcal. pap.</note> and Archbiſhop <hi>Anſelme</hi> complained that <hi>William Rufus</hi> would not allow any to be called for thirteen yeeres together; which by the file of ſtory, compared with that Epiſtle, made up the kings whole
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152542:83"/> Reigne. And this was queſtionleſſe the cauſe that we finde ſo little touch upon Parliamentary aſſemblies in the Norman times, Kings being too high to be controlled, and Biſhops too proud to obey; But neceſſity of State, like unto fate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes againſt all other intereſts whatſoever; and the wiſdome of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt in this prevailed above that of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as farre as their will was beyond his. For it was boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for him to hold out againſt the Church that ſtood in need of all ſorts to confirme to him that which common right (as then it was taken) denied him; and therefore (though it coſt him much trouble with <hi>Anſelme</hi>) he recontinued the liberty of publique conſultations, and yet maintained his dignity and honour ſeemly well. I ſhall not need to cleare this by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, for beſides the publique conſultations at his entrance, and twice after that, for ſupply or ayd for his warres, and the marriage of his daughter with the Emperour, its obſerved that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſummoned a Councell at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but it was <hi>authoritate Regia,</hi> and that there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>magnae multitudines Clericorum, Laicorum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conten. Wigorn. An. 1127.</note> 
                  <hi>tam divitum quam mediocrium;</hi> and that upon the third day the debate was <hi>de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiis ſaecularibus nonnullis:</hi> The iſſue of all was, that ſome things were <hi>determinata,</hi> others <hi>dilata,</hi> and other matters <hi>propter nimium aeſtuantis turbae tumultum ab audientia judican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium profligata.</hi> Out of which may be probably concluded, 1. That the Laity as yet were preſent in Councels with the Clergy. 2. That they were all in one place. 3. That they all had votes, and that the major mumber concluded the matter. 4. That certain perſons uſed to determine of the major number by the hearing, and that the votes were ſtill <hi>clamore non calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> 5. That they held an order in debating of affaires, <hi>viz.</hi> on ſome daies Eccleſiaſticall, and on other daies ſecular. 6. That all matters concluded were atteſted by the King, who as tis ſaid, did give his conſent, and by his authority did grant and confirme the ſame. And upon the whole matter it will be probable that as yet Councels, and thoſe now called Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments differed not in kind, although poſſibly there might be difference of names, in regard that ſome might be immediately and mainly occaſioned, and urged by Temporall exigences,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152542:84"/> and others by Eccleſiaſticall; but whether Temporall or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall the firſt occaſion was, yet in their meetings they handled both as occaſion offered it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Clergy could not attaine the ſole legiſlative power, ſo neither had they the ſole juridicall power in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſticall cauſes; for not onely in caſe of errour in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call courts was an appeale reſerved to the Kings court, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Saxons time: but even thoſe things which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med properly of Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance were poſſeſſed by the Kings Court in the firſt inſtance, as that of <hi>Peter</hi>-pence, which was a Church-tribute, and might be claimed to be proper the Church cogniſance much rather then Tythes; and yet by the Law of this Kingdome in the Conquerours time it is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially provided,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 20. Spicil. 180.</note> that defaults of payment of that duty ſhall be amended in the Kings Court, and a fine for default was given to the King, albeit that the Biſhop was made the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and the Pope the Proprietor. And many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which were holden to be of Eccleſiaſticall cogniſance, Kings would draw them within the compaſſe of maintaining the peace of the Church, which properly belonged to them to defend; and ſo had the cogniſance of them in their own Courts, and fines for invaſion of the Church rights. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this may ſeem but colourable, and by way of flattery of the Churches right, and not in oppoſition thereof: In other things it will appeare plainly that Kings were not nice in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating their own claim in matters which the Clergy held theirs <hi>quarto modo,</hi> as namely in the caſe of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a weapon firſt faſhioned by the Churchmen, and in the exerciſe whereof themſelves were in repute the onely maſters; and yet in this were maſtered by Kings, whoſe Laws directed and reſtrained the ſwelling of that cenſure,<note place="margin">Eadmer. hiſt. p. 6. Ll. H. 1. cap. 5.</note> and made it keepe meaſure; whoſe Tenants and Officers or ſervants muſt not be medled with by this cenſure, but by the Kings leave; nor muſt they be called to anſwer but in the Kings Court. That right ſtill remained to them after the ſpoile made by the Hierarchy upon the rights of all the reſt of the free men, and therefore could not of right be called <hi>nova</hi> in the Hiſtorians ſence; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was no other then the ancient cuſtome uſed amongſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152542:84"/> the Saxons before that the Clergy had either purpoſe or power to reach at ſuch a height as afterwards by degrees they attained unto. Furthermore, the Hierarchy as they neither could poſſeſſe the legiſlative nor juridicall power in Church matters; ſo neither could they poſſeſſe themſelves: for as yet they were the Kings men, and the more the Kings men, becauſe they now thinke a Biſhopricke but a naked commodity, if not robed with a Barony. Nevertheleſſe, before that ever they knew that honour, what ever the Canon was for their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet both their title and power <hi>de facto</hi> was derived to them from the Kings, who alſo inveſted them with Staffe and Ring; nor had the Pope as yet (though he had conquered the Hierarchy) poſſeſſed himſelfe of their colours; but during all the Norman times the Kings maintained that trophie of the right they had from their predeceſſors, notwithſtanding the many aſſaults from <hi>Rome,</hi> and treacheries of the Cathedrals within the Realm;<note place="margin">Eadmer. Hiſt. l. 2. p. 53. &amp; l. 3. &amp; l. 4. Eadmer. hiſt. l. 1. &amp; l. 5. Wigorn. An. 1128.

               <p>In the next place, as they were the Kings men, ſo their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks and Dioceſſes were under the Kings power to order,

               <p>Laſtly, what ever the firſt intention of this recited Statute were, it may probably be judged, that it was but a noiſe to ſtill the Clergy; and that it never had more then a liveleſſe ſhape, not onely in regard of the before-mentioned particulars, but eſpecially in regard of that ſubſervient law of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt concerning the County court which reciteth it as a cuſtome in his time uſed,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 7.</note> that the Biſhop and Earles, with other the chiefe men of that County were there preſent as aſſiſtants in dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of judgement.

The Prelacy on the contrary grew unruly, yet too weake for the rugged ſpirits of the Norman Kings; they are glad to be quiet, and the Pope himſelfe to drive faire and ſoftly, as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it expedient <hi>poteſtatem Regalem mitius tractandam,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLVIII.</hi> Of the ſeverall ſubſervient juriſdictions by Provinces, Marches, Counties, Hundreds, Burroughs, Lordſhips, and Decennaries.</head>
               <p>HAd the Normans owned no other title then that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, doubtleſſe their mother wit muſt needs have taught them the expediency of preſerving the particular ſubſervient juriſdictions of the kingdome, intire and unquaſhed, if they regarded either the benefit of their conqueſt, or reward of their parteners and allies; unleſſe it ſhould be allowed unto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querous, to be more honourable for them to doe what they will, rather then what is meet. But hereof there is no cauſe of queſton in this preſent ſubject: for nothing is more cleare then that <hi>VVales</hi> enjoyed in the Conquerours time, and for ages after him, its ancient liberties, Tribute excepted; nor did conqueſt ever come ſo nigh to their borders as to trench upon the liberties of the Marches. For as it had been a piece of ſtate nonſence to have holden two peoples under conqueſt, and their Marches in freedome; or to preſerve them in good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood by Marches, which by the law of Conqueſt were made one: ſo was it no leſſe vaine if all had been once ſubdued by conqueſt, to have raiſed up the liberties of the Marches any more.</p>
               <p>And as they had leſſe cauſe to have invaded the bounds and ancient limits and partitions of the Counties,<note place="margin">County courts</note> ſo queſtionleſſe had they ſo done, they would have taken the old courſe of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152542:86"/> the <hi>Micklemote,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eadmer. hiſt. l. 4. p. 96.</note> as they did divide the Dioceſſe of <hi>Lincolne</hi> into two Dioceſſes by advice of the Biſhops, Princes, and other wiſe and holy men,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 6.</note> and turned the Abby of <hi>Ely</hi> into a Biſhops See. But it was their wiſdome to preſerve the ancient Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; and no leſſe both wiſdome and care to continue their due priviledges and intereſts to each. Every County had its Court,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 41. &amp; 42.</note> and every Court its wonted juriſdiction: No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint muſt be to the Kings Court if right may be done in the County; no diſtreſſe muſt be taken but by warrant from the County, and that muſt be after complaint thrice made. The County court muſt be called as our anceſtors have appointed:<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 64.</note> ſuch as will not come as they ought, ſhall be firſt ſummoned, and in caſe of default deſtrained, at the fourth default; the complainant ſhall be ſatisfied out of the diſtreſſes ſo taken, and the King alſo for his fine. Theſe are the expreſſe Laws of the Conquerours own eſtabliſhment;<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 64.</note> the laſt of which alſo was confirmed by another expreſſe Law, ſaving that he would allow but of two ſummons and two diſtreſſes, before execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as it was one principall worke that he undertooke to reduce the Lawes into courſe, which had been intermitted during the violent times of his father and brother (the firſt of whom never had liberty for reformation, and the latter never had will) ſo amongſt other Laws he ſetled thoſe concerning the County court,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 7.</note> namely, <hi>That the Biſhops, Earles, and chiefe men ſhould be preſent for direction.</hi> 2. <hi>That it ſhould be holden once each moneth.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Church matters ſhould precede, and then the Crown pleas. And laſtly, the Common pleas;</hi> beſides ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars concerning pleading, and proceedings in the handling of cauſes. Neither were theſe cauſes of a petty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard onely, but of greateſt concernment: One example I ſhall remember the reader of,<note place="margin">Epicil. 197.</note> and not recite <hi>in terminis,</hi> but referre to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Seldens</hi> own pen. The occaſion was this: <hi>Odo</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours halfe brother was by him made Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with had the gift of a large Teritory in <hi>Kent;</hi> and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Kings diſpleaſure at the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stigand.</note> poſſeſſed himſelfe by diſſeiſin of divers Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging to that See: <hi>Lanfrank</hi> the ſucceeding Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop being informed hereof, petitioned to the King that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:152542:86"/> juſtice might be done him <hi>ſecundum legem terrae;</hi> And the King ſends forth his Writ to ſummon a County court: the debate laſted three daies before the free men of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the preſence of many chiefe men, Biſhops and Lords, and others skilfull in the Laws; and the judgement paſſed for the Archbiſhop <hi>Lanfrank</hi> upon the votes of the free men. This County court was holden by ſpeciall ſummons, and not by adjournment, as was allowable by the Saxon Law upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occaſions: And this ſuit was originally begun, and had its finall determination in the County court, and not brought by a Tolt out of the Hundred court, as is ſuppoſed by an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable reporter; nor by the ancient laws could the ſuite commence in the Hundred, becauſe the Lands and Tenements did lie in ſeverall hundreds and Counties. The upſhot of all is that the County courts in thoſe daies were of ſo great eſteem that two of the greateſt Peeres of the Realme, one a Norman, the other an Italian, did caſt a title in fifteen mannors, two Townſhips, with many liberties upon the votes of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders in a County court, and that the ſentence was allowed and commended by the King, and ſubmitted to by all.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to come to the Hundred Courts,<note place="margin">Hundred court.</note> of which there are by the Normans allowed two ſorts; the firſt whereof was holden twice a yeere: This was formerly called the Torne, and was the Sheriffs Court; hereof little notice is taken,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen 1. c 8.</note> ſaving that by the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt its worke ſeems to be much deſigned to the view of free pledges. But the more ordinary Court, is that which belongs to the Lord of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, unto whom alſo belong the fines in caſes there concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>This Court is to be holden once in each moneth;</hi>

                  <hi>and no ſuit to be begun in the Kings Court that regularly ought to begin in the Hund ed. No diſtringas ſhall iſſue forth till three demands made in the Hundred. And three diſtreſſes ſhall then iſſue forth; and if upon the fourth the party appeare not, execution ſhall be by ſale of the diſtreſſe, and the complainant ſhall receive ſatisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by the latter Laws of the ſame King there is but two ſummons allowed, and then two diſtreſſes;<note place="margin">Ll. Hen 1. c. 64.</note> and in caſe no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be, execution ſhall be for the complainant, and for the Kings fine.</p>

               <p>As touching inferiour Courts of Tows and Mannors, there's little obſervation to be had,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Courts of Towns and Mannors.</hi> Ll.

But in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more did the Norman Kings ſhew their paternall love to the Common-weale,<note place="margin">Decenners.</note> then in the law of pledges or Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for as of all other beauties it ſuffered moſt blemiſh from the ſtorme of the Norman invaſion; ſo was it their eſpeciall care to renew the life thereof, not now amongſt the natives onely, but joyning the Normans to the Saxons in the ſame bond of brotherhood, utterly drowned thereby, all memory of Lordly power, and ſo of divers peoples making one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered even conqueſt it ſelfe, if any were, and made all joynt-partners in one common liberty.</p>

               <p>View of free pledges muſt be to ſee that the Decennaries be full; and if any be departed, to enquire the cauſe: and if any be come in, whether he be under pledges or not.</p>
               <p>And thus the Norman Kings had their people under treble guard: one of fealty, the other of aſſociation, and the third that of pledges; and all little enough to ſecure that which they in their own conſciences might have ſome cauſe to queſtion, whether it belonged to them or not.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLIX.</hi> Of the immunities of the Saxon free men under the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man government.</head>
               <p>THe freedom of an Engliſh man conſiſteth in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: Firſt, in ownerſhip of what he hath. Secondly in voting any Law wherby that ownerſhip is to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: and thirdly, in having an influence upon that Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory power that muſt apply that Law. Now that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh under the Normans enjoyed all this freedome unto each mans own particular, beſides what they had in bodies aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, may appeare, as followeth: The free men of <hi>England</hi> were ſuch as either joyned in the warre with <hi>Harold</hi> againſt the Normans; or ſuch as abſented themſelves from the way of oppoſition or enmity, and were either waiting upon their own affaires, or ſiding with the Normans: and queſtionleſſe all the ſadneſſe of the warre befell the firſt ſort of the Engliſh; whoſe perſons and eſtates (to make the waies of the firſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>William</hi> regular, and of one piece) never fell ſo low as to come under the Law (or rather the will) of conqueſt; but in their worſt condition were in truth within the directory of the Law of forfeiture for Treaſon againſt their Soveraigne Lord, whoſe claim was by title, as hath been already noted. The other ſort either did appeare to be the Normans friends, or for ought appeared ſo were; and ſo never offending the Law never ſuffered any penalty; but held their perſons and poſſeſſions ſtill under the patronage of Law, as anciently they and their anceſtors had done; and that this was the Normans meaning, they publiſh the ſame to the world in a fundamentall Law, whereby is granted,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 55.</note> That all the freemen of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall have and hold their Lands and poſſeſſions in heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right for ever.</p>
               <p>And by this being ſecured againſt forfeiture, they are further ſaved from all wrong by the ſame law which provideth,</p>
               <p>That they ſhall hold them well or quietly, and in peace free
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152542:88"/> from all unjuſt Tax, and from all Tallage, ſo as nothing ſhall be exacted nor taken, but their free ſervice which by right they are bound to performe.</p>
               <p>This is expounded in the Laws of <hi>H.</hi> 1. cap. 4. that no tribute or tax ſhall be taken, but what was due in the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors time.</p>
               <p>Under the word Tax is underſtood <hi>monetagium commune per civitates,</hi> or <hi>comitatus;</hi> ſo as aides and eſcuage are not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for they are not charged upon Counties and Cities, but upon Tenures in Knight-ſervice: nor was Dane grelt hereby taken away, for that was a Tax in the Confeſſors time, and granted by Parliament.</p>
               <p>So then the Norman Kings claimed no other right in the lands and poſſeſſons of any of their ſubjects, then under and by the law or common right; and they conclude the law with a <hi>ſicut,</hi> which I thus Engliſh, As it is enacted to them, (or agreed by them) and unto them by us given and granted by the Common-councell of our whole Kingdome.<note place="margin">Statutum eſt eis, &amp; illis à nobis datum &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſum per com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune concilium totius Regni nostri.</note> I leave the words to be criticized upon as the Reader ſhall pleaſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well aſſured that the moſt ſtrained ſence can reach no further then to make it ſound as an eſtoppell or concluſion to the King and his ſucceſſors, to make any further claim unto the eſtates of his ſubjects then by Law or right is warrantable; under which notion conqueſt never did nor can come, as ſhall more fully be manifeſted hereafter. But the right genius of this law will alſo more evidently appeare by the practice of thoſe times, which even when juſtice it ſelfe did moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſo tenderly regarded the liberty of mens eſtates, that no diſtreſſe could iſſue without publique warrant obtained,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 42. &amp; 45.</note> and upon three complaints firſt made, and right not done; and when rape and plunder was in the heat, and men might ſeem to have no more right then they had power to maintaine: yet even then this Law was refuge ſufficient for ſuch as were oppreſſed;<note place="margin">Gloſſ 227. Camb. Brit. Norff.</note> and was pleaded in barre againſt all uſurpations and intruſions, under pretext of the Conquerours right whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as by the caſe of <hi>Edwine</hi> of <hi>Sharneburne</hi> may appeare. Secondly, that the free men of <hi>England</hi> had vote in the making of Laws, by which <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> was bounded and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152542:88"/> as may appeare by what hath been already ſaid; nor ſhall I endeavour further therein. Thirdly, they had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the judicatory power; for firſt, the matter in fact was determined by the votes of the free men, as the Lawes of the Conquerour, and of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt doe ſufficiently manifeſt. Secondly, they had an influence in the making of the Sheriffe, who as well as the Biſhop was by election of the people.<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 15.</note> Thirdly, they had an influence upon all Judges by ſetting a penall Law upon them in caſe of corruption; which if not ſo penall as to take away life, was nevertheleſſe penall enough to make an unjuſt Judge to be a living pattern and example of miſery, to teach others to beware.</p>
               <p>Two things more muſt be added, though ſomewhat colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall to this purpoſe. Concerning the right of the free men in the common Mint, and in their villains. Concerning the Mint,<note place="margin">Ll. Aethelſt. c. 6 Ll Aetheldr. c. 22.</note> that the Saxons having made it as parcell of the demeſnes of the kingdome, and leaving to the King onely an overſeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, reſerved the controll and chiefe ſurvey thereof to the grand Councell of the kingdome, who had ſtated the ſame in the Confeſſors time. But after him the Normans changed the current according to their own liking, till by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt it was reduced into the ancient courſe,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1.</note> allowing no money but ſuch as was currant in the daies of the Confeſſor, whoſe laws alſo (with ſome alterations by the Conquerour, with common advice) he alſo eſtabliſhed. Concerning the Lords right to their villains it is obſervable, firſt,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 65 &amp; 66.</note> that liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement was allowed, which could never have been, had not the liberty of the ſubject been ſaved. Secondly, that Infranchiſement properly is the worke of the people, or the body, and the Lord was to deliver his villaine by his right hand unto the Sheriffe in full County court, and pronounce him free from his ſervice, and ſhall make roome for him by free paſſage and open doores, and deliver him free armes, <hi>viz.</hi> a Lance and a Sword, and then he is made a free man, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to all intents and purpoſes.<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 66.</note> Otherwaies there might be manumiſſion, as if the villaine remained in a City, Burrough, walled Town, or Caſtle by a ſpace of a yeere and a day, and no claime made to his ſervice by his Lord, he ſhall be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:152542:89"/> free from the ſervice of his Lord for ever; and yet this manumiſſion could not conclude any but the Lord and his heires or aſſignes: nor could it inforce the body to allow that for a member which was none before. Thirdly, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they allowed the Lords liberty of infranchiſement,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. 65.</note> yet would they not allow them free liberty of diſpoſing them as other chattels; nor by the law of the Conquerour might they ſell their villains out of the Countrey, or beyond Sea, for the King had right to the mediate ſervice of every villaine, though the Lord had the immediate; and therefore that Law might hold in force: nevertheleſſe the Ordinance that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelme</hi> made, that no Lord ſhould ſell his villaine, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow for a Law, nor did it hold in force.</p>

I doe not finde this miſdemeanour to be formerly ſo much taken to heart by the Crown; nor poſſibly would it have been at this time, but that the King muſt protect the Church, if he meane to be protected by it: and it was taken kindly by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, till they found they were able enough to defend their owne right by themſelves.

               <p>I ſhall conclude this ſubject with theſe three obſervations: Firſt, that the Laws in thoſe ancient times of the Normans were ſo generall, as they then made no difference between pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or perſons;<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 10.</note> but whether the peace was broken upon holy or common ground, or upon a Lay-man, or one in orders, the Lay power ſeiſed upon all. The ſecond is the care they had for apprehending of the offenders in this kind. If the party ſlaine were a Norman or Frenchman,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 53.</note> the Lord of the manſlaier was charged to have him forthcomming within a certaine time, or to pay the Kings fine of 46 Marks ſo long as he had wherewith to ſatisfie, and what remained the whole Hundred was charged. But if the party ſlain were of any other people,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 26.</note> the Hundred was immediately charged with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer, and muſt bring him to anſwer within a certaine time, or pay the Kings fine. The third and laſt is, the care they had to prevent breach of peace for the future: Firſt in ſetling of nightwatches by all Cities, Burroughs, Caſtles, and Hundreds, in ſuch manner as the Sheriffe or chiefe Officers by common councell ſhall adviſe for the beſt ſafety of the Kingdome.<note place="margin">Ll.

               <p>THe Laws that concerne Lands, and peculiarly belonging to the Normans, are ſuch as concerne principally the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of Lands; which if duly conſidered, although ſavoured ſomewhat of the King, yet little of the Conquerour: for generally it muſt be granted that tenures long before and after this time, were as the ſervices, ordered according to the will of the giver, in which as the King had the greateſt ſhare, and he the moſt publique perſon of all: ſo were his donations or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered chiefly to advance the publique ſervice; and in this regard the tenure by Knight ſervice might more principally challenge the Kings regard then the regard of all the great men beſides. But this was not the ſoare, yea rather it was the beauty and ſtrength of the Kingdome; and for which the King deſerved an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name above moſt of his progenitors, who had not ſo much land to diſpoſe of as he had, and therefore could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance that ſervice in any proportion equall unto him. The ſore that cauſed ſo many ſighes, was the incumbrances raiſed upon this moſt Noble and free ſervice, which through the evill of times by this meanes became the moſt burthenſome and the onely loathed and abhorred ſervice of all the reſt. I ſay through the evill of times; for it cannot lodge in my thoughts but in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:152542:92"/> the Norman times the incumbrances were nothing ſo great as of latter ages, and that much hath been imputed to the Lawes of the Conquerour, which they never deſerved, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in theſe particulars, which the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt have preſerved in memory.</p>

               <p>The ſence hereof in ſhort is, that theſe might marry at their own will, without paying fine or compoſition to the Lord, and yet muſt have the liking of the Lord ſo farre as to declare whether the man intended were his enemy or not, and fit to performe Knight ſervice. This law was therefore grounded upon the preſent diſtreſſe of affaires, wherein the nation was unſetled, and common right having eſtabliſhed a mutuall truſt between Lord and Tenant found out this meanes to preſerve the ſame; for if the marriages of thoſe that are related to the Tenant in ſuch manner as may inherit part or all his lands, or have joynture therein, ſhould be left altogether at the liberty of the Tenant or his widow; it muſt needs follow that the mutuall truſt between Lord and Tenant muſt faile, and the publique receive dammage. And therefore if this cuſtome were of Norman birth, it was begotten bpon a Saxon law, and might the rather be owned by the Engliſh.</p>

And the Normans were neceſſitated to introduce this cuſtome of theirs with themſelves, partly becauſe it was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge which was their own by birth, and it could not be waved without an evident wrong done to the wives of theſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152542:93"/> men who had ventured their lives in that ſervice; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally becauſe it would not conſiſt with the worke in hand to diſclaime that cuſtome which muſt needs be of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in the effecting of what was principally ſought after, <hi>viz.</hi> the union of the two peoples Normans and Saxons into one: I ſay it was principally ſought after by the Norman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, if not led thereto by his own genius, yet neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto by force of reaſon of ſtate, as ſhall appeare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And what could be imagined a more ready way to ſtay the effuſion of blood, and all other unhappy events of enmity, then by taking away enmity it ſelfe? or a more ſpeedy and certaine courſe for union, then to reduce the men and women of each people to mutuall ſociety, and to ſeale up all by a laſting bond of marriage? or greater encouragement for the comfortable proceedings therein, then the ſetling of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant maintenance of the wife, in caſe of ſurvivorſhip by the law of dower of the Lands and Tenements of the Husband?<note place="margin">Lindenbrog. Concil. Aen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. c. 19. Ll. Edm.</note> which was ſo full of contingencies, and uncertainties in the portion of goods that was by the Saxon law appointed to the wife in ſuch caſe. Nor was this all; for by marriage thus made to the Normans they had a great hold, not ſo much over the Engliſh, as in the Engliſh, and that not onely during coverture, but by reaſon of this title of Dower the women became te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and under the Lords wing, ſo as they durſt not willingly and illegally offend their Lord in their widdowhood, nor by law nor reaſon match themſelves and their dowry to any other that was not firſt allowed by the Lord to be in friendſhip with him; and thus became the tenants widdows to be at the liking of the Lord for their marriage: and the like hereto may be ſaid concerning the husband in caſe of tenant by the curteſie;<note place="margin">Miror fo. 20.</note> and however by the Norman former practiſe it was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed; yet by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt it was again reduced to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer right, rather then originall ariſing from his grant, as ſome hold, and proved advantagious for the ends aforeſaid. Now as touching their marriage portion of goods, becauſe the Saxon law had already endowed them thereof, they could not be induced to lay down their known ancient right, till they found the new law of dower to ſettle, and ſo for ſome
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:152542:94"/> time both laws were in force, untill the more ancient Saxon law had an honourable buriall. Nevertheleſſe for the preſent the law abridged that right ſo farre as to limit it to the widdow during widdowhood, according to the former Saxon law. Upon conſideration of all which it may well be conceived that the power of the Lords in conſenting or diſſenting to the marriages of their tenants, widdows, and wards, was not ſo much an uſurpation upon the common right of the Engliſh ſubjects, as a cuſtome rationally, and with great wiſdome, as the courſe of affaires then ſtood, upholden and allowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, principally for the ſpeedy ſetling of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able government, and conſolidating of two Nations into one, and wherein <hi>England</hi> was then ſo happy as to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in ſeven yeeres, which coſt their anceſtors nigh two hundred yeeres experience with the Britons, beſides a world of bloodſhed that might have been ſpared, ere they could finde out the right way to a deſired peace by mutuall marriages had between them.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:152542:94"/> concerned herein; and upon the ſame generall ground the ſurvey of fooles accompanied the former, albeit it was not in practiſe till <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt brought it in, as the <hi>Mirror of juſtice</hi> ſaith (fo. 258.<note place="margin">Ll.

For my own part I will not diſpute the point whether this cuſtome of Wardſhip was purely Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or whether it was derived from the Saxons anciently, who poſſibly might have ſome reſpect to Orphans, in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to traine them up for the publique ſervice in point of war, eſpecially being poſſeſſors of a known right of reliefe, as well as <hi>Alfred</hi> the Saxon King did undertake the worke for the training of ſome ſuch particular perſons in learning for the ſervice of the publique,<note place="margin">Aſſer Menev.</note> in time of peace and civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet thus much appeareth that guardianſhip of Lands was a known cuſtome enough to make and maintaine a right, and that it by law was a right belonging to ſome perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, and that this had been a cuſtome before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unjuſt cuſtoms crept into government of the Conquerour, and principally of his ſonne <hi>Rufus:</hi> and though it be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable whether it ſetled firſt upon the Normans or the Engliſh, yet its manifeſt that if one people had it, the other people now comming into union with that people, could not in reaſon except againſt that cuſtome which the other people had taken up upon ſo honorable grounds as reaſon of State, which as the times then were, was evident and ſuperlative; eſpecially the cuſtomes being under the regulating of Law, and not of any arbitrary power, and can be no preſidents of the reliefe, marriage and wardſhip that after ages uſurped.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LIV.</hi> Of the Militia during the Normans time.</head>
               <p>THe power of Militia is either the legiſlative or executory power; the legiſlative power without contradiction reſted in the grand Councell of the Kingdome, to whom it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to eſtabliſh laws for the government of the kingdome in time of peace. And this will appeare in the preparation for warre, the levying of warre, and mannaging thereof after its levied: for the preparation, it conſiſteth in leavying men and munition, or of money; In all which queſtionleſſe will be a difference between raiſing of warre by a King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge a perſonall injury done to the Kings own perſon, and a warre raiſed by the whole Kingdome, or repreſentative body thereof, which is commonly done in defence of publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and ſeldome in any offenſive way, unleſſe in recovery of a right of poſſeſſion, either formerly loſt, or as yet not fully ſetled. Now although it be true that ſeldome do inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reflect upon the Kings perſon alone, but that the Kingdom will be concerned therein to endeavour a remedy; yet becauſe it may fall out otherwiſe, Kings having been occaſioned to leavy war of their own accord, but in ſuch caſe could neither compell the perſons of his ſubjects or their eſtates to be contributory. And of this nature I take the warre leavied by <hi>Harold</hi> againſt the Conquerour to be, wherein the greateſt part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was never ingaged, nor therefore did it feele the dint of the Conquerours Sword at all; and in this caſe the Militia
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:152542:96"/> muſt be allowed to ſuch as beare the purſe: nor can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be the Militia of the Kingdome, nor any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, although it may connive thereat. But to ſet this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration aſide, as not coincident at all with the Norman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements after they were crowned, and to take all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent warres to be meerly defenſive of the right of the Crown, as in ſober conſtruction they will appeare to be: as touching the levying of money, its evident that it lay onely in the power of the grand Councell of the Kingdome; for otherwiſe the laws were ſetled that no Tax ſhould be made or taken, but ſuch as were due in the Confeſſors time, as formerly hath been ſhewed. Secondly, for the preparing of men and munition, it was done either by tenure or by ſpeciall law; as touching tenure, it was provided by way of contract, that thoſe that held by Knights ſervice ſhould be ready with their Armes to aſſiſt the King for the defence of the Realme: So as they were not bound by their tenure to ayd him in any other caſes.<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. cap. 57.</note> Others were alſo by eſpeciall law of the Land bound to be ready for their ſervice in that kind: For all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Kingdome held their eſtates under a generall ſervice, which by common right they are bound to performe, <hi>viz.</hi> in time of danger to joyn in defence of their Countrey: This is the common fealty or allegiance which all men owe;<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. c. 59.</note> and which if neglected or refuſed, renders the party guilty of treaſon againſt his Countrey, and his eſtate under the penalty of forfeiture, according to the old Saxon law revived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 13.</note> Thus the law made preparation for the war, both of men and Armes.<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. 61.</note> Caſtles and Forts were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe either firſt made by the order of the grand Councell, or otherwiſe allowed by them for the defence of the Commons, and the Kingdome; ſo was the law of <hi>William</hi> the firſt. The levying and mannaging of the warre muſt not be denied <hi>de jure</hi> to belong to the repreſentative body, ſo farre as may conſiſt with the directory part, for that it is a maine part of the government of the Kingdome in times of warre: And therefore <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, amongſt his laws made in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of law making, provideth for the ordering of men in the army in the field, and eſtabliſhed a law, that ſuch
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:152542:97"/> as forſooke their colours or aſſociats in the field, during the battell, ſhould be puniſhed with death, and forfeiture of is whole eſtate. Nor yet can it be denyed but that <hi>de facto</hi> Kings of their own accord, and by ſecret Councell did direct therein; either in the vacancy of Parliament, which was the generall caſe of the firſt times of the Norman Conquerour, and the whole reigne of <hi>Willam Rufus;</hi> or by connivance of the grand Councell, while they ſaw nothing done but what was well done.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 13.</note> Nor can it be rationally ſaid that Kings by ſuch advice as they have (in the receſſe of the grand Councell) levying warre in defence of the publique, according to rules, doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then their duty; or if the grand Councell looke on, ſee nothing miſgoverned, and ſay nothing, that they doe other then is meet; For it muſt be remembred, that Kings in their firſt originall were rather Officers for warre, then peace; and ſo are holden by all Antiquity, and as Generals in warre were called <hi>Reges</hi> or <hi>Imperatores</hi> by the Grecians, Romans, and Germans: and at ſuch times as warre was concluded, at the generall meeting of the people they choſe their <hi>Dux</hi> or <hi>Rex,</hi> call him which you pleaſe; and he being choſen, all bound themſelves to be at his command, and to defend his perſon: ſo as while a King keepeth within his place, in time of danger its his duty firſt to ſtirre himſelfe, and ſtir up the reſt; to lead them and order them, as may be moſt for the publique defence, and to governe the Army by ſuch Lawes as are or ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by order of the publique meeting, and in caſe of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den exigences to uſe his own wits; and in all this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon liberty no whit infringed, in regard that all is for the publique defence, to which the Knights are bound by their tenures, and all others by the law. And this was this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes caſe in the Normans time, that both Leaders and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whether by election of the people, or preſcription, yet all ſerved for the defence of the Kingdome. Nor were they compelable to any other ſervice inconſiſtent therewith, nor to ſtand to any judgement in ſuch caſes differing from, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that of the Parliament it ſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LV.</hi> That the entry of the Normans into this Iſland could not be by conqueſt.</head>
               <p>THat in point of fact the entry of the Normans into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was not by Conqueſt, will ſuficiently appeare from what hath been already noted. I ſhall make one ſtep further, and ſhew, that as affaires then ſtood with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, it was impoſſible for him to merit that name againſt the ſtream of providence, that had preingaged him to three ſorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Normans, the Clergy, and the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be taken for a ground that Duke <hi>Willam</hi> muſt give all faire correſpondency to the Normans, conſidering they are members of his own body, and the arme of his ſtrength, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could doe nothing. And its not leſſe certaine, that however the Sea divided the two Countries, yet long before the arrivall of the Army,<note place="margin">M. Weſt. An. 1072. Ll. Gulielm. c. 55.</note> the Normans and Saxons were ſo well acquainted by the latter acceſſe of the Danes, that partly by marriage and other intereſts the Normans made ſo great a party in <hi>England,</hi> as that party merited no leſſe from the Duke in his enterance, then thoſe he brought with him; and therefore both they and their allies in all reaſon muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch reward of their faithfulneſſe to him, as the other had; nor could the Duke deny the ſame, unleſſe he had diſclaimed his own intereſts, whereof he had none to ſpare. Secondly, their merit from the Duke was accompanied with no leſſe mutuall relation to his Army, being of the ſame blood with themſelves, and of ancient acquaintance, and as impoſſible for the Duke to keep them from conſociation with the mixed people, as to abſtract the mixed people each from other; one or both of which muſt be done, and the Conquerours muſt be kept from incorporating with the conquered, or elſe the law of conqueſt cannot hold. Thirdly, if theſe two had failed, yet
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:152542:98"/> had the Duke by his manner of rewarding his Army diſabled himſelfe from holding, however he might ſeem to have by conqueſt. This was his gift of Mannors, Lands, and Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto his ſouldiers, compleated with their ancient rights, and priviledges in free ſervice; otherwiſe it had been little better then a trap to bring his own men into bondage, who but lately were free ſouldiers under no better then a Duke of their own election; and their government in their own Countrey, however big, yet had not yet brought forth a ſoveraignty into the world; their Duke no compleat King, nor themſelves ſo mean as vaſſalls; and it was equally difficult for him to get up higher, as for them to ſtoop lower: And however, it was dangerous now for the Duke to try maſteries, unleſſe he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hazzard all, and to change the ſubſtance for the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Laſtly, to lay them all aſide, and to take the Normans as in themſelves conſidered, a people under ſuch laws and cuſtomes as were the ſame with the Saxons, and originally in them, and from them derived into Normandy by <hi>Rollo,</hi> or ſome other; or take them as a people willing to lay aſide their own law, as ſome writers affirme, and more willing to take up the Daniſh cuſtomes, which were alſo very nigh a kinne to theirs, and in part ſetled by the Danes, in that part of the Kingdome where themſelves moſt reſided. It muſt be concluded, that a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by law was intended, and ſuch a law that was no way croſſe to the fundamentall laws of this Kingdome, but concurring therewith; In every of which regards the future generations may juſtly claime their immunities as ſucceſſors and heires unto the Normans, albeit no Saxon could have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed or derived the ſame to poſterity.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of men that made the King uncapable to hold by conqueſt was the Clergy, a conſiderable part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in thoſe daies, when as in every Nation they grew check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and in this Kingdome had well nigh the one halfe of the Knights fees, and thereby a principall part of the ſtrength of the Kingdome, beſides the conſciences of them all; and for a reſerve they had the Pope in the reare, whoſe power in every Kingdome was little inferiour to that of the Kings owne, and therefore ſufficient to ſtop an abſolute conqueſt, unleſſe it were
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:152542:98"/> firſt conquered. But the King came in upon great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in both theſe regards: For whereas his pretence upon his entery was to advance juſtice principally toward the Clergy, who formerly were wronged by <hi>Harold</hi> or voiced ſo to be, this bound him from injuſtice and oppreſſion; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the Pope had him in a double bond; one as Prince of the Engliſh Clergy; the other as Judge of the title of the Crown by the Kings own election; and that by ſentence; for the King had merited of him, if not to hold the Crown it ſelfe by fealty to the Roman See, yet by ſuch ſervices, as that the tripple Crown ſhould be no loſer. The King therefore muſt reſolve to have no more to doe with the Church then will ſtand with the Popes liking, unleſſe he meaned to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture himſelfe and all he had into the danger of the great curſe, of which the King would ſeem more ſenſible then perhaps he was. Nor were thoſe times of the Church ſo moderate, as to bring forth Churchmen that would catch the good will of the Laity by condeſcention, or Popes of that height of perfection as to part with one tittle of their great Titles, much leſſe ought of that pitch of power which they had griped, though it would ſave the world from ruine. In all which regards the Norman Duke was too far inferiour to attaine by conqueſt any thing in this Kingdome, wherein the Pope or Clergy claimed ought to have or doe.</p>
               <p>A third ſort of people avoided the dint of conqueſt either by timely ſiding with the Norman, or by conſtant reſiſting of him, or by neutrality. Of the firſt ſort were many,<note place="margin">Hoveden. lib. 6.</note> both Lords and others, that by affinity and conſanguinity were become Engliſhmen to the Norman uſe; others were purchaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Clergy, that were zealous for the Popes honour, that was engaged in the worke.<note place="margin">Ingulſus 512.</note> Of thoſe likewſe that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in the defence of the liberty of their Country there were not a few that purchaſed their liberty, who otherwiſe might under pretence of treachery have forfeited the ſame to the rapacious humour of the Conquerour; and this was not done onely by valour, for <hi>Normandy</hi> ſtood in a tottering condition with their Duke; partly drawn away by the French, that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Duke would be too ſtrong for them; and partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:152542:99"/> their own further ayd, leaſt their Duke ſhould be too great for the Dutchy. It was therefore wiſdome in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour to ſettle the Engliſh affaires in the faireſt way to gaine them for himſelfe, who had been ſo brave againſt him. But the greateſt number, eſpecially of the commons, looked on while the game was playing, as contented with the caſt of the Dice, what ever it ſhould be. Theſe were afterwards by the King looked upon, not as enemies (as the preſident of <hi>Edwin</hi> of <hi>Sharneburne</hi> witneſſeth ſufficiently) but upon ſuch as either were or by faire carriage would be made his friends;<note place="margin">Gloſſ. 227.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concluded them under a law of aſſurance, that they that had been ſo peaceable, ſhould have, and enjoy their Lands as intirely and peaceably as they had formerly done before his entry. To conclude therefore this point: if theſe three parties of the Engliſh Normans, the Engliſh Clergy, the ſtout Engliſh, and the peaceable Engliſh be ſet aſide from the title of conqueſt, it will be probable that not one tenth part of the Kingdome were ever under other change then of the Governours owne perſon.</p>

               <p>THe clamours in ſtory that the Conquerour altered and made laws at pleaſure, brought in new cuſtomes, mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the perſons and eſtates of the people with depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, extortions, and oppreſſions, and others of that nature have made latter times to conclude his government to be (as of a Conquerour) meerly arbitrary, and that he did what he liſt: how different this concluſion is from the intent of thoſe Writers I know not; but if the Kings title and government was as a Conquerour, then was his will the onely law, and can adminiſter no cauſe of complaint of wrong and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore if theſe be taken in nature of complaints,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:152542:99"/> they declare plainly that there was a law in title, or elſe there could have been no tranſgreſſion or cauſe to complaine. But if the Reader ſhall apprehend theſe paſſages in Writers to be no other then ſober relations, then were it not amiſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider from what ſort of men theſe complaints or relations doe proceed, <hi>viz.</hi> from Writers that have been cloyſtered men, little ſeen in affairs of State more then by common report and rumour; prejudiced by the Kings diſpleaſure againſt their Cloyſters, and therefore apprehenſive of matters in the ſaddeſt ſence, and many times far beyond the truth, and might as well be ſuppoſed to miſrelate, as to miſtake. For if we ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> touch upon particulars, I thinke no man will deny but the King allowed property indifferently, as well to Normans as Engliſh, if the premiſſes be rightly conſidered: and therefore though ſomewhat be true of the plundering of houſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, perſecuting of the Engliſh Nobility, depoſing of Biſhops and Abbots, whereof they ſpeake; yet all might be deſervedly done in a legall way, and in execution of juſtice, whereof Hiſtories are not altogether ſilent; Nevertheleſſe, if in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution the King did ſhew a kind of rage, and ſome raſhneſſe, it might be imputed to the common infirmity of great men; for as oppreſſion upon thoſe that are inferiour, makes them mad, ſo doth treachery againſt them that are ſuperiour make them little other; eſpecially if they be overtaken with a fit of paſſion in the inſtant, or their minds wrapped into a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole of affaires.</p>
               <p>But the change of laws makes the greater noiſe; wherein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what change they ſuffered, may appeare from the premiſſes, if Writers have delt uprightly; Otherwiſe generall imputations without particular inſtances will never ſway opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the currant of the laws that are publiſhed, eſpecially ſeeing we have obſerved the errour of the beſt Hiſtorian of thoſe times, in calling thoſe things new which were anciently uſed in <hi>England,</hi> before <hi>Normandy</hi> was in a condition of a ſtate. Yet if this ſhould be granted, and that there were ſuch change of laws as is pretended, it makes nothing to the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſo long as the new laws are made by advice of common Councell, and for the common good; and ſo long as they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:152542:100"/> are eſtabliſhed to be rules for government. I remember its affirmed by ſome of thoſe ancient Writers, that the Duke or King would have brought in the cuſtomes of <hi>Norwey,</hi> but the earneſt mediation of the Engliſh prevailed againſt it; and it evinceth two things to my opinion: firſt, that there was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion made what law ſhould be eſtabliſhed. Secondly, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the intereſt that the Normans had in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they could not prevaile to bring in the whole body of their law, or of the cuſtomes of <hi>Norwey,</hi> which were not onely the <hi>prima materia</hi> of their law, but alſo in kind had a ſetling at that very time in thoſe places of this Kingdome where the Danes had their principall ſeate; and therefore not altogether ſtrange to the Saxons themſelves. The ſumme of which will be this, that upon debate a law muſt be ſetled, and that not the law of the Conquerours own will, nor the law that ſuits with his deſire; but the ancient law of the Kingdome: and therefore if at any time the unquietneſſe of ſome of the Engliſh brought the King to ſome thoughts of arbitrary rule, and to ſhake off the clog of Saxon law; it was long ere it ſtirred, and ſprang up too late to raiſe the title of conqueſt; and withered too ſoon to ſettle it.</p>
               <p>As touching the change of cuſtomes (for that alſo is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Conquerour) it cannot be denied but ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be in matters of ſmaller conſideration; yet are the Writers not without miſtake in the particular inſtances; For whereas they tell us that the Conquerour tooke away the cuſtome of Gavell kinde, and brought the cuſtome of diſcent to the eldeſt ſonne; and that <hi>Kent</hi> ſaved their liberties and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued this cuſtome of Gavell kinde; I ſhall not contend about the liberties of <hi>Kent,</hi> but muſt till I ſee better reaſon hold the opinion of the change of inheritance to be a meere conceit: For (beſides what hath been already ſaid concerning that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Gavell kind) if we believe <hi>Glanvile,</hi> the difference was between Lands holden by Knights ſervice,<note place="margin">Lib. 7. cap. 3.</note> and in ſocage: the firſt of which in his time by ancient cuſtome alwaies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the eldeſt: and thoſe Lands that were holden in Socage (if not partible by cuſtome, in which caſe they went equally to all the ſonnes) went by cuſtome in ſome places to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:152542:100"/> the eldeſt, in other places to the youngeſt; ſo as the rule of inheritance in the Norman times was cuſtome, as well as in former times. And furthermore, if the cuſtome of Gavell kind had been the generall cuſtome of this Nation, the King by his change had contradicted his own Prerogative, and granted as great a liberty to his ſubjects as could have been invented: For had the cuſtome of Gavell kind happened upon the Lands in Knight ſervice, it had brought all the ſonnes under the law of Wardſhip, and had made a ready way to inthrall all men of worth, and undoe all husbandry; the firſt whereof had been as advantagious to the Kings private intereſt, as both deſtructive to the publique.</p>
               <p>Nor is it cleare from any Authour of credit, that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> changed the tenures of Lands; albeit that it cannot be denied but ſuch Lands as he had by forfeiture, or otherwiſe, were in his own power to diſpoſe upon what tenure he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for as well before the Normans time as long after, tenures were like as the ſervices were, all at the will of the donor; and were of as many individuals almoſt as the minds of the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſome being of more generall regard and publique uſe,<note place="margin">Littlet.</note> are recorded amongſt the grounds of Engliſh laws; none of which appeare to me to be of Norman originall, although they received their names according to that dialect.</p>
               <p>The next thing objected is the change of Language, which thing ſome Writers tell us the King endeavoured; or which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> worſe, to be ſo abſolute, as to be abſolute tyrant, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh laws in a forreigne language, that the people through ignorance might the rather tranſgreſſe, and thereby forfeit their eſtates This (if true) ſo far differed from the nature of a Conquerour, as rather proveth that he was put to his ſhifts: Nevertheleſſe the thing taſteth ſo much of ſpleen, as it might occaſion diſtruſt of other relations concerning this ſubject: For beſides that it is nonſence for a Conquerour to entitle himſelfe by a cheat, where he hath an elder title, by conqueſt; I ſhall in full anſwer to that calumny inſert a paſſage of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian that was in the continuall view of publique affaires in thoſe times, who ſpeaking of the Conquerour ſaith, That he commended the Confeſſors laws to his Juſtices in the ſame
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:152542:101"/> Language wherein they were wonted formerly to be written,<note place="margin">Ingulfus.</note> leſt through ignorance the people might raſhly offend. And another Authour ſaith,<note place="margin">M. Paris. fragm. Gulielm.</note> that the King had a deſire to learn the Engliſh tongue, that he might the better know their Law, and judge according thereto. Its probable nevertheleſſe, that the laws were in the Norman tongue; and its no leſſe likely that the pleadings, in reall actions eſpecially, were alſo in the ſame Language; elſe muſt the Normans be put to ſchoole to learne Engliſh, upon perill of loſſe of their eſtates: but that either the written laws were wholy concluded into the Norman Tongue, or that the publique pleading of cauſes by word of mouth in all actions where the iſſue was left to the Countrey, were in any other Language then Engliſh, no adviſed Reader will conceive: ſeeing it had been a madneſſe for an Engliſh Jury to paſſe their verdict in any caſe wherein its likely many of them underſtood ſcarce a ſyllable of the Norman language, much leſſe ought of the matter upon which their verdict ſhould be grounded. Adde hereunto, that its not likely but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour inhibited the uſe of the Engliſh language in all matters of publique Record, in as much as the Charters made by him to corporate Towns and Franchiſes were ſometimes in the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more generally in the Latine, but ſeldome or never in the Norman dialect; and that pleadings and indictments were entered in like manner in the Latine Tongue (as formerly by an old cuſtome brought in by the Clergy was uſed) for the Clergy, who had gotten the Key of knowledge and Law into their own cuſtody, layd it up in that Language whereof the Commons had little knowledge, that they might thereby be enforced to depend upon theſe men for juſtice, as well as for piety. The Normans therefore either found it too hard to alter the former cuſtome in ſuch caſes; or elſe thought it the wiſeſt way to chooſe the Latine as a third Language indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as well to the Normans as Saxons, and beſt underſtood of any forreine Tongue beſides: and yet endeavoured to bring both peoples into one Language, as they were intended to be one people; and to preſſe the uſe of the Norman Tongue in publique affaires, ſo farre as might conſiſt with good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice, leaving time and occaſion to worke the iſſue,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:152542:101"/> which doubtleſſe was much, and had been more, had the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race continued in the Throne. But falling out otherwiſe, the Engliſh blood prevailed in the head, and the Language continued poſſeſſion, mixed onely with ſome Norman words, as the people were alſo a mixed people. So as the Language was changed, though it was altered.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, its affirmed that the Normans did impoſe a new cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome called Coverfeu; and its thought by ſome to be a meere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vaſſalage, that every man at the noiſe of the Bell every night muſt put out both fire and Candle; and yet is a matter of ſo ſmall concernment, that (of being in its own nature conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient) <hi>Scotland</hi> received it without ſuch coercion; and can be reputed for no other then a ſeaſonable advice, which any Corporation in time of danger might order within their own Precinct, without tranſgreſſing the liberty of the ſubjects. Of leſſe conſequence is that change, which is alledged was brought in by the Normans in the ſealing of Deeds of conveyance, by ſeting a print upon Wax annexed to the Deed, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was wont to be by ſetting a print upon the blanke at the end of the Deed; and yet its looked upon by ſome as a trophee of conqueſt or abſolute government: concerning which, I will not diſpute whether the Normans firſt brought in this courſe, but ſhall reſt in this, that the King being about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the unity of the Laws in the ſuperſtructure as well as in the fundamentals, if herein and in ſome other particulars the Engliſh ſubmitted to the Normans, they likewiſe ſtooped to the Engliſh Law in other things: and therefore ſuch concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ought not to be imputed unto a conquering power, but unto moderation amongſt a company of wiſe men.</p>
               <p>Thus having glanced at the changes of Property, Lawes, Tenures, Language, and ſome cuſtomes, we come to that which is the maine occaſion of all theſe complaints, I meane unlawful Taxes, afforſtinges, and other ſuch oppreſſions upon the eſtates of the people: concerning which I purpoſe not to contend, for much thereof is like to be true: the Norman Kings (eſpecially the two <hi>Williams</hi>) being under continuall occaſion of expence, many warres, more provocations, which kept them ever in action, and that wrought their ſpirits into
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152542:102"/> an immoderate heat, little inferiour unto rage; and ſo they might ſoon outreach their bounds, and ſit heavy on the people; and in ſuch occaſions no man eſcaped, Norman nor Engliſh, Clergyman nor Layman; nor did the Kings themſelves come off ſuch gainers, but that they might ſometimes put up their gettings into their own eyes, and ſee never a whit the worſe. And yet to doe them right, they were not alwaies of ſuch ſad influence, but had their <hi>lucida intervalla;</hi> eſpecially he that had the leaſt cauſe, I mean the Conquerour, who certainly was a man of a ſerious regard, and did not onely remit ſometimes his rigour in exacting where he ought not, but alſo forbare to require that which he had ſome colour to demand: for whereas the Daneguelt was left unto him in the nature of an annuity, he was contented to turne it into a ſumme in groſſe, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it onely <hi>Cum ab exteris gentibus bella vel opiniones bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum inſurgebant;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoveden.</note> and it was then done <hi>conſultis magnatibus.</hi> Theſe things thus conſidered, might have mollified ſomewhat the Pennes of angry Writers; and where they faile, may be caution to Readers to conſider occaſions and diſpoſitions of Princes; and ſo long as Laws hold in title, to conſtrue the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of Princes to be but as ſteps out of the path to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd a little dirt, that a man may get home the more cleanly; and therefore rightly can derive no other title of abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to their ſucceſſors then to hold by infirmity. And thus the Government under the Normans at the worſt was but like that of childhood, following ſudden and preſent deſires; not wiſe enough to plot for abſolute Monarchy, nor to keepe off a polity, which ſtill rooted underneath, though the fruit, while it was now green was harſh and unpleaſant.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Norman diſcourſe with this advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that notwithſtanding the words <hi>Conquerour</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> have often faln from my Pen, and hereafter may doe the like, yet can I ſee no reaſon why divers ſucceeding Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Crown by argument of the Sword, and not by right of deſcent, may not deſerve the Laurell as well as the firſt Norman King; onely becauſe fame hath fancied him that Title, under a kind of preſcription I do the like.</p>

               <p>I Have cut out this portion of one hundred twenty and five yeeres (containing the reignes of theſe Kings) apart from their ſucceſſors, in regard of their titles; all of them being under one generall climate, and breathing one ayre of election, and compact between them and the people. Now was the iſſue male of the ſtocke of <hi>Normandy</hi> quite waſted; I meane in relation to ſucceſſion by inheritance: for although it was the lot of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt to have many children, yet it was not his happineſſe to have many lineal; nor to hold what he had; nor of them all was there left above one that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Crown, and it a daughter, who was the great Grandmother to all the ſucceeding Kings till this day. Onely King <hi>Steven</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Steven.</note> like an unruly ghoſt comming in upon the Stage troubled the play during his time. This daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt was married to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and ſurviving him was in her fathers life time acknowledged to be his heire; (the Sea having formerly ſwallowed up the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his hope) unto her the Lords ſware fealty as to the next ſucceſſor in the Throne after the deceaſe of her father, being led thereto by the inſtigation of her father, whoſe conſcience told him that the Title to the Crown by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance was weakned by his own preſident, himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the ſame by election of the people, contrary to the title of his brother <hi>Robert.</hi> Nevertheleſſe this was not the firſt time that the Engliſh Crown refuſed to be worne by practice; for <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt being dead, <hi>Steven</hi> the younger ſonne to a younger ſiſter of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt put up head; who being of the Royall ſtemme, a man, and a brave Souldier, by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152542:103"/> courſe of the Saxons, had title enough to be thought upon in a doubtfull ſucceſſion. Beſides, he was a rich man, and had enough to raiſe up his thoughts to high undertakings; and a Brother, a Biſhop and Legate to the Pops here in <hi>England;</hi> one who was of a high ſpirit, and vaſt power; advantages e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have quickned a much duller ſpirit then his was, who was the ſonne of a daughter to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour; and to make him yet more bold, he had the upper ground of the heire, who was a woman, diſadvantaged by a whiſpering of wilfulneſſe, and cuſtomary government like an Empreſſe; which was too high a ſaile for an Engliſh bottome, wherein ſo precious a treaſure as the ſubjects liberties was to be ſhipped. Thus provided, <hi>Steven</hi> ſtepped up to the Engliſh Throne, and with proteſtations of good government entered and made up the match both for Crown and Scepter, the people waving the title both of Empreſſe and heire; the pretenſions of the E. of <hi>Bloys</hi> elder brother to <hi>Steven</hi> gave way to the common law and liberties of the ſubject to faſten root and gather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence after the violence of the Norman blaſts was out of breath; thus making way over hedge and ditch of all Oathes, till the King was quietly ſetled in the Throne.</p>
               <p>Quietly, ſaid I? that I muſt retract; for he never had quiet during his life, though generally was victorious, and did as much as a King could doe that had the paſſions of a man and Souldier, to give the ſubjects content. The true cauſe whereof was an errour in the tying of the knot; wherein he neither became theirs, nor they his: For the fealty that was ſworn to him was but conditionall and <hi>eouſque;</hi> and yet the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were abſolute, and better obſerved then the peoples were, poſſibly becauſe his engagements were more. For beſides his proteſtations, the King pledged his brother the Legate to the people, and morgaged himſelfe to his brother; and to boot gave both to the Clergy and Barons liberty to build and hold Caſtles for their private ſecurity: the iſſue whereof may mind, that too much counterſecurity from the King to the people is like ſo many Covenants in marriage, that make room for jealouſie, and are but ſeeds of an unquiet life; and thus it befell
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152542:103"/> this Kings reigne. His firſt troubles are brought in by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, as if they dropped from Heaven, yet probably came immediately from without, <hi>viz.</hi> from beyond Sea where the Empreſſe was: for as the Kings engagements were in their firſt heate on the one ſide, ſo was alſo the Empreſſes choler on the other ſide, and therefore might make the firſt aſſault; and the Kings firſt ſucceſſe therein falling out proſperouſly for him, conceited him that he was ſtrong enough to encounter his own Covenant, although in truth he invaded but the skirts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; I meane that collaterall ſecurity of Caſtles: for by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience he now feeles that they are blocks in his way, he muſt therefore have them into his own power. But the Clergy are loth to forgoe their pawn till they had their full bargaine, (for now they were working hard for inveſtures of the Mitred Clergy under the patronage of a Legate that had the King in bonds) acted their parts ſo well as they ingaged the Nobility for their liberty of Caſtles, in which atchivement the King was taken priſoner. The Empreſſe betakes her ſelfe to the Clergy, and by the Legates meanes procures a kind of election to be Queen; but ſhe ſicke of the womans humour, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much of the Empreſſe, and too little of the Queen; and forgetting that the Engliſh Crown would not fit an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, unleſſe ſhe could fit her head firſt to it, choked her owne title by prerogative, and ſo let the Crown ſlip through her hands, which fell upon the head of <hi>Steven</hi> againe, who maintained it by his Sword, after by compoſition, and then died a King; and thus like a vapour mounted up by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, toſſed by tempeſts for a time, and at length falling, gave way to the Crown to have its free courſe to the Empreſſes ſon by <hi>Geoffery Plantagenet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henry</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</note> the moſt accompliſhed for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, courage, and power, of all his predeceſſors, and one that wanted nothing but purpoſe to have undone what the foregoing Princes had done, in the ſetling of the liberties of the people; for the ſubjects were tired with the unquiet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and the Clergy in diſtraction through the Schiſme in the Popedome between <hi>Victor</hi> the fourth and <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152542:104"/> third; and very unfitting all were to diſpute the point of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative with ſo mighty a Prince. And it was the wiſdome of God to order his affaires ſo, as that he was not very fit to diſpute with the people in that caſe: for his title to the Crown was not very excellent, being neither heire to the laſt King that reigned, nor to the laſt of that title, I mean to <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt; but ſonne onely to the Empreſſe, who was now alive, and by deſcent was to be preferred before all other. His title therefore is clearly by compact and agreement made between the Lords, King <hi>Steven,</hi> and himſelfe, all being then ready to try the right by the Sword to that to which none of them had any right at all at that time, but by the favour of the people. Nor did the King ever after diſpute the ſtrength of this title, although before he died, his mothers death conveyed over to him what right of deſcent ſoever was conſiſtent with the Law of the Crown; nor did occaſion favour him thereto: for as its never ſeen that any man is honoured by God with many advantages, without proportionable imployment for the ſame; ſo it befell with this King; His great Territories in <hi>France</hi> brought jealouſie in the reare; and it ſtrife and contention with <hi>France,</hi> enough to turn his thoughts from waxing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton againſt his own people: and therefore his wiſdome taught him to preferre peace at home to the chiefe of his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; to become ſomewhat popular, and yet to looſe nothing of a King thereby; his way was to keepe the Church men down, that had during his predeceſſors time grown, whether more obſtinate againſt the King, or inſolent over the people, is hard to judge; and in this he had the people to friend; and might have prevailed much more then he did, but that the people feared the threats of <hi>Rome</hi> more then he; and himſelfe (if not guilty of <hi>Beckets</hi> death) more the conceit of fame then there was cauſe: theſe concurring with unnaturall troubles from moſt unthankfull ſonnes, made that ſpirit of his to faile that formerly knew no peere; as its often ſeen that the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirits are ſooner quelled with ſhame and griefe, then with feare of any danger whatſoever. Towards his Lay-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects he was more regardant for the ſetling of Laws, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152542:104"/> of juſtice, ſo as ſome have thought him the firſt wombe of our Engliſh laws; others more truly the firſt <hi>Mecoenas</hi> ſince the conqueſt that brought on the ſpring time of a ſetled Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, and thereof left this faire teſtimony by his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth that Primroſe of Engliſh laws, under the name of <hi>Glanvill,</hi> letting all men know that thenceforth <hi>England</hi> would no more vale it ſelfe in an unknown law, but explaine it ſelfe unto the World to be a regular government, ſuch was the Kings Idea; yet was he touched with ſo much of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmity of Kings as ſhewed him to be a man; eſpecially in his old age, being loaden with military affaires, wherein he had been long exerciſed, he had contracted ſome ſhifting courſes of a ſouldier in gathering money, and ſouldiers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of the rode way of an Engliſh King,<note place="margin">Hoveden. 348.</note> and led an ill example to future ages: nor had he other ſalve for this wound, but that it was for the honour of Chriſtian faith, and for the ſake of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next comes in <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">Richard the firſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds ſonne both in birth and courage; yet was his behaviour to his father ſuch that his meritorious holy warre could never wipe it out of the Callender of ſtory. His entrance was upon an election made in his fathers life time, and the ſame confirmed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of homage from the Peeres.<note place="margin">M. Paris.</note> The ſad troubles that this election amongſt other things occaſioned to his father in his old age ſhow plainly that <hi>Richard</hi> truſted not to the title of inheritance; nor the French King (that tooke his part) unto the Engliſh cuſtome, for the poſſeſſion of the Crown; but all muſt be done in the life of the father, that muſt ſecure the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the ſonne when the father is dead: and thus is he entred upon the Throne, not as heire, but as ſucceſſor to his father, yea rather as ſurvivor, taking poſſeſſion of what was by ſpeciall compact conveyed to him by the means of his father in his lifetime, though ſore againſt his will, if writers ſpeake true. As his entrance was, it promiſed a better government then followed; for though it was for the moſt part hidden in the wombe, as himſelfe did ſubſiſt in an other world, yet by a ſecret providence he was given over to the election of ill depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152542:105"/> and therefore he was not welbeloved, however deere he was to this Nation. A third part of his government was ſpent in a calm with Pope, Clergy, Commons, and all Nations that were not Infidels, upon conſcience it ſeems that he ought not to be troubled who adventured his perſon ſo bravely in the holy warre.

               <p>The generall temper of his government ſheweth that though the King muſt be thought ſober, yet the man was mad; for he hauked at all manner of game, <hi>France, Scotland, England,</hi> Laity, Clergy, ſpared not the Pope himſelfe, ſcorned to ſtoop to occaſion; all which he did by the ſtrength of the name of a King, till at length being well cuft and plumed, he was faine to yoke his lawleſſe will under the grand charter, depoſe his Crown at the Popes foot, and inſtead of a King became little better then a chiefe Lord in <hi>England.</hi> Thus although <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt forgot this mans diſloyalty, yet God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it: for the King having gotten the Pope upon the hip, and put him to his laſt ſhift to ſtirre up the French to ſet his curſe on worke was by an hidden providence conquered in the middeſt of a Royall Army, without view of enemy, or other weapon then a meere noiſe; his Nobility (either ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting all would be gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> or expecting that the King would not deny them their own, ſeeing he had been ſo profuſe in giving away that which was not his) demand that their liberties might be confirmed; but he being loath to be mated by his Nobles, though he was overmatched by the Pope, armes himſelfe with the Popes curſe, and the Lords themſelves with the French mens power: thus the tables are turned, and the French playing an after-game to gain to themſelves the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> after they ſaw the death of a Warlike King diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their deſigne before it was ripe; and in the concluſion were beaten out of the Kingdome by a child.</p>
               <p>Its not worth inquiry what the King allowed or diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for it was his courſe to repent of any thing done contrary to his preſent ſence, and made it his chiefe principle in policy to have no principle but deſire; wherein he triumphed too long by reaſon of the contentions between the Clergy and the Laity, which comming nigh unto the puſh of the pike, and the King ready for the ſpoile of both; the Barrons and Clergy ſuddenly cloſe their files, and like a ſtone-wall ſtood firm to each other till the King wearied with ſucceſsleſſe labour

                  <hi>CHAP. LVIII.</hi> Of the ſtate of the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and during the reigne of theſe ſeverall Kings.</head>
               <p>UNder the title of the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all ſuch as are of the greateſt eminency for birth or wiſdome and learning, and advancement into place of government and honour. Theſe were in the Saxons times the flower of the people, flouriſhing onely from the honour that aſcended from beneath their deportment then was full of cheere and ſafety to the people: after that royalty ſprung up, the influence thereof upon them exhaled ſuch a reciprocall intereſt backe againe as made them leſſe regardfull of their own roote. Whereas we ſee the more mature flowers are the more propence to turne head and looke downward to their own originall. This diſtemper was yet much worſe by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of the Normans, whoſe Nobility, beſides their titles of honour in their own Country, obtained by cuſtome ſuch command and power amongſt the meaner ſort, being ſouldiers under them in time of the ſervice in the field; that when the warres had breathed out their laſt, neither of them could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or were very carefull to lay aſide. This was obſerved by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152542:106"/> Kings, and advantage eſpied to clime to the top of Monarchy by the helpe of theſe great men, whom if they could make their own, all would be theirs; and wherein they had prevailed much more then they did, if they had been wiſe enough to have maintained them in unity; but in that failing, Kings were neceſſitated to take parties, and ſerve the Nobility to ſave the maine: and thus continued they a conſiderable party in the gouernment of this kingdome from the Normans for the ſpace of two hundred yeeres well nigh, to the prejudice both of the growth of the prerogative of Kings and liberties of the Commons; and benefit of none but the Lords, who in thoſe unquiet times were the chiefe Commanders in the field. This errour of Kings was ſoon eſpied, but could not be avoyded; its naturall to man to be proud, and to ſuch to fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: another courſe therefore is taken, <hi>viz.</hi> to raiſe up ſome ſo high as may overtop all, and keep them under; nor is it altogether without reaſon, for Kings are no ubiquitaries, and ſome muſt beare their power where they cannot be perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preſent, yet it is dangerous to beſtow too much upon one man; for there is no man fitting to be a King but himſelfe that is a King; and where kings are immoderate in beſtowing power, it many times workes much woe to the people, and not ſeldome ſorrow to the Kings themſelves. The place of the chiefe Juſtice was in ſhew but one Office, yet in theſe times was in nature of the Kings Lieutenant-generall through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the kingdome. A power and worke too great for any one man in the world, that can make no deputies to mannage it;<note place="margin">Hoveden. 443, 375. Nubr. lib. 4. cap. 14.</note> and yet in thoſe times you ſhall meet with one man made up of an Archbiſhop, a Legate, and chiefe Juſtice of <hi>England;</hi> or a Biſhop, a Lord Chancellor, a Legate, and chiefe Juſtice of <hi>England;</hi> and a ſtrange kind of government muſt that needs be wherein the ſervants Throne is above his maſters, and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhall have a plenitudinary power beyond that which his Lord and King was, as the times then were, was capable of. By theſe and ſuch like pluralities the great men of <hi>England</hi> kept the Commons below and themſelves above, and probably ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the temper of the government of this kingdome more
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:152542:107"/> Ariſtocraticall then in after ages. And if their perſonall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was of ſuch value, how much rather in their joynt aſſembly or court of Councell; concerning which I muſt agree that as in their originall in <hi>Germany</hi> they did conſult and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the meaner matters, that is to ſay, of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning property, and therefore were in their moſt ordinary worke meetings of Judges, or Courts of Judicature: and alſo matters of defenſive warre, becauſe themſelves were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: and laſtly, in matters of ſudden concernment to the State, not onely to ſerve as eyes to foreſee, but to provide alſo if they can, or otherwiſe to call in the ayd of the peoples advice; ſo alſo they continued this courſe, and it may be now and then (as all Councels have done) ſtrained their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours beyond their reach (eſpecally ſince the Normans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance:) and therefore I ſhall not deny but that they alone with the King, and without the Commons, have made many Laws and Conſtitutions, ſome of which now are called Statutes, (although many of them in truth are no other then rules for Judicature, which ordinary Courts may frame; or Judgements in particular caſes, ſuch as are the conſtitutions at <hi>Clarindon</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time) and many other Laws which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be made between the King and his Lords. Nor can I looke upon ſuch laws otherwiſe then as upon judgements in Courts of Juſtice in new points of controverſie, grounded upon ancient grounds, which properly are not new Laws, but the ancient rule applied to new particulars; and being ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world, may beare the name of Laws, Ordinances, Conſtitutions, or Judgements; the word Statute being of later times taken up and uſed in a more reſtrictive ſence, of which more in their due place. Now that this Court was a ſetled Court of judicature,<note place="margin">Hoveden. An. 1175.</note> and ſo uſed, may appeare in that fines were leavied therein, and Writs of right determined; as in that great caſe between the two Kings of <hi>Navarr</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> referred to the judgement of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and tried in this Court; its ſaid that the triall was by plea, and if need wereby battell. The Judges in this Court were the Baronage of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for the entry of judgement in that great caſe is thus,

                  <hi>Comites &amp; Barones Regalis Curiae Angliae adjudicaverunt, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as though doubtleſſe many were abſent, ſome being enemies, others diſcontented, others upon other occaſions, yet all might claime their votes as Barons. The Preſident over all the reſt was the chiefe Juſtice, or if the King were preſent then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and by him was the ſentence or judgement declared, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the entry in the caſe aforeſaid, <hi>Habito Concilio cum Epiſcopis, Comitibus &amp; Baronibus adjudicavimus &amp;c.</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Court was great ſo long as the Lords had liberty or care to attend thereon: but when Kings began to have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſts they would have theſe to be more private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which weakned the eſteem of concluſions that there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and reduced the honour thereof ſcarce to the degree of a Conventicle; and by this means the neceſſity of calling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole body repreſentative was made more frequent, the power of the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> decayed, and this Court forfeited all its juridicall power to the three Courts at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> viz. the <hi>Kings bench, Common pleas,</hi> and <hi>Exchequer;</hi> ſaving ſtill the ſupreame judicature unto the grand Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Eſtates in Parliament, where all the Lords had liberty of meeting, and free voting without impeachment.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LIX.</hi> Of the ſtate of the Clergy, and their power in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the Normans time.</head>
               <p>IF the prerogative of Kings prevailed not to its utmoſt pitch during the Normans time, it did much leſſe in theſe times ſucceeding, wherein the Clergy tooke up the Bucklers and beate both King and Commons to a retreat; themſelves in the interim remaining ſole triumphers in the field. In their firſt adventure they paced the ſtage, no man appearing to oppoſe: <hi>Steven</hi> then was King by their leave, and their Bondſervant; and they might have any thing ſobeit they would ſuffer him to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:152542:108"/> enjoy his Crown. His brother the Biſhop was the Popes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the Churchmens patron, and the Kings ſurety; in whom the Clergies favour to the King, and his good behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them and all men concentred: Beſides all this, the King was but ſo upon condition, and there being no better title then election, conſcience in thoſe times was well enough ſatisfied in the breach of covenant on their part; where on the Kings part it was firſt broken. All this the King ſaw full well; and therefore what can he deny to ſuch benefactors? Vacances of Churches he readily parts with; and his right of inveſture of the Mitred Clergy he diſpenſed: ſo as he opened the way to his ſucceſſors of an utter dereliction of that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. He ſees his brother the Legate deflower the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by maintaining appeales from the Courts in <hi>England</hi> unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he ſays nothing; he is contented with the ſtumpe of the Crown, and (with <hi>Saul</hi>) if he be but honoured above or before all others of the people, its his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: But the Clergy, like the barren wombe hath not yet enough. The King hath allowed them Caſtles, and too late he ſees that inſtead of being defencas againſt the Imperiall power of the Empreſſe, they are now made bulwarkes againſt the lawfull power of a King; he had therefore endeavoured to get them down, and gotten ſome of them into his power. The King himſelfe is now ſummoned to anſwer this before a Legatine councell, wherein his brother is Preſident: that was a bold adventure in them, but it was extreame raſhneſſe in him to appeare and plead the cauſe of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> before a Conventicle of his own ſubjects: And thus to ſecure <hi>Rome</hi> of ſupremacy in appeales, he ſuffers a recovery thereof againſt his own perſon in a court of Record; and ſo loſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſave the Crown. Thus are Synods mounted up on Eagles wings; they have the King under them, they will next have the Crown. Within a while <hi>Steven</hi> is taken priſoner: the Empreſſe perceiving the power of the Clergy, betakes her caſe to them now aſſembled in Synod; they now proud of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (and conceiting that both Law and Goſpell were now under their decree) publiſh that the election of the King
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152542:108"/> belongeth unto them, and by them the Empreſſe is elected Queen in open Synod, <hi>Stevens</hi> brother leading the game; and had ſhe been as willing to have admitted of the Laws as <hi>Steven</hi> was, ſhe had ſo continued, and had left a ſtrange preſident in the Engliſh government for poſterity. But the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> who had made the way to the Throne for <hi>Steven,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Synod to ſober conſideration, and helped the kings return unto his Throne again, wherein he continued a friend to the Clergy during the reſt of his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond ſucceeded him; as brave a man as he, but beyond him in title and power, and one that came to the Crown without preingagement by promiſe or Covenant, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that which was proper for a King. A man he was that knew full well the intereſts in the government, the growing power of the Clergy, and the advantages loſt from the Crown by his predeceſſor: and to regaine theſe he ſmoothes his way towards theſe braving men, ſpeaks faire, proffers faire;<note place="margin">M. Paris: An. 1155.</note> he would act to increaſe the bounds of the Church: he would have the Popes leave to doe him a kindneſſe, and ſobeit he might gaine an intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he would take it from the Pope; who pretended, as heire of Jeſus Chriſt, to have the Iſlands and utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion; and, as if he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be as good to the Church as <hi>Steven</hi> was, and much better, he deſires the Popes kindnes for the confirmation of the liberties and cuſtoms of his Crown and kingdom; and no ſooner deſired then obtained. This was the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> example of a King of <hi>England,</hi> but the firſt of an Engliſh king that ſought to <hi>Rome</hi> for right in the Crown; and thereby taught the Pope to demand it as a priviledge belonging to the Tripple crown. Nor was <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond leſſe benigne to the Church-men, till he found by his deere bought experience that he had nouriſhed Scorpions; and would have ſuppreſſed them, but was rather ſuppreſſed himſelfe; as in that ſhamefull ſucceſſe of the death of <hi>Becket</hi> may appeare, wherein he yeelded the day up to the Clergy, who formerly ſcorned to ſtoop to the greateſt Potentate on Earth. The ſtate of Kings is to be pitied, who muſt maintaine a politique affection above, and ſometimes againſt nature it

The Biſhops ſide with <hi>Becket:</hi> the King intending the perſon, and not the Calling, ſingles out the Archbiſhop, and hunts him to ſoile at <hi>Rome;</hi> yet before he went the King puts the points of his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in writing, and made both Archbiſhop and Biſhops ſigne them as the rights of his Crown, and as the <hi>Conſuetudines A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae:</hi> but <hi>Becket</hi> repenting went to <hi>Rome</hi> and obtained the Popes pardon and bleſſing, the reſt of the Biſhops yeelding the cauſe.</p>
               <p>The particulars in debate were ſet down in the nature of Laws or Conſtitutions, commonly called the Conſtitutions at <hi>Clarindon,</hi> which ſhew the prevailing humour that then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the body of the Clergy in thoſe daies, and therefore I ſhall ſumme them up as follows:</p>

               </p>
               <p>This had been quarrelled from the firſt Normans time, but could never be recovered by the Clergy. Before the Normans time the County courts had them, and there they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before the Biſhop and Sheriffe; but the Eccleſiaſticall cauſes being reduced to Eccleſiaſticall Courts, and the Sheriffe &amp; the Laity ſequeſtred from intermedling: the Normans accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome in their own Country, reduced alſo the triall of rights of Advouſons unto the Supreame courts, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the Kings title was much concerned therein, and the Norman Lords no leſſe; but principally in regard that Rights require the conſideration of ſuch as are the moſt learned in the Lawes.</p>

The ſecond alteration reſteth in the <hi>ſalvo,</hi> which is a clauſe never formerly allowed, unleſſe by practiſe in <hi>Stevens</hi> time, when as there was little regard of the one or the other: Nor doth it concurre with the file of ſtory that it ſhould be inſerted within theſe conſtitutions,<note place="margin">Conſtit. at Clarindon.</note> ſeeing that writers agree it was the chiefe cauſe of quarrell between him and <hi>Becket,</hi> who refuſed ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without the clauſe, and at which the King ſtooke with the Archbiſhop for the ſpace of ſeven yeeres, which was ſix yeeres after the Conſtitutions were conſented unto, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon.</p>

Secondly, that the Clergy eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the greater ſort queſtioned their ſervices due by tenure, as if they intended neither Lord nor King, but the Pope onely. Doubtleſſe the uſe of tenures in thoſe times was of infinite conſequence to the peace of the kingdome, and government of theſe Kings, when as by theſe principally not onely all degrees were untied and made dependant from the

               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient Law of the Saxons, that no Tenements holden by ſervice could be aliened without licence or conſent of the Lord, becauſe of the Allegiance between Lord and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Now there was no queſtion but that Churches might lie in Tenure as well as other Tenements; but the ſtrife was by the Churchmen, to hold their Tenements free from all humane ſervice, which the King withſtood.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Upon the ſame ground with the former: for the Lord had not only right in his tenant, which could not be aliened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent, but alſo a right in his tenants children, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they in time might by deſcent become his tenants, &amp; ſo lie under the ſame ground of law: for although this be no aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by legall purchaſe, yet it is in nature of the ſame relation; for he that is in a Monaſtery is dead to all worldly affaires.</p>
               <p>Theſe then are the rights that the King claimed, and the Clergy diſclaimed at the firſt; although upon more ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they generally conſented unto the five laſt: but their Captaine Archbiſhop <hi>Becket</hi> withſtood the reſt, which coſt him his life in the concluſion, with this honourable teſtimony, that his death <hi>Samſon</hi> like effected more then his life; for the maine thing of all the reſt the Pope gained to be friends, for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:152542:112"/> the loſſe of ſo great a ſtickler in the Church affaires, as <hi>Becket</hi> was.</p>
               <p>In this Tragedy the Pope obſerving how the Engliſh Biſhops had forſaken their Archbiſhop, eſpied a muſe through which all the game of the Popedome might ſoon eſcape, and the Pope be left to ſit upon thornes in regard of his authority here in <hi>England.</hi> For let the Metropolitane of all <hi>England</hi> be a ſworne ſervant to the Metropolitane of the Chriſtian world, and the reſt of the Engliſh Biſhops not concur, it will make the tripple Crown at the beſt but double.<note place="margin">Antiq.

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Pope therefore meaned not to truſt their faire natures any longer; but puts an oath upon every Engliſh Biſhop, to take before their conſecration, whereby he became bound

               </p>
               <p>This ſeemeth to paſſe ſomewhat from the Crown, but loſt it nothing; for if the Clergy accepted of this grant, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by allow the Crown a right to make it, and a liberty to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its own right, or continuing the ſame by being ſole judge of the neceſſity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the licentious times of King <hi>Steven,</hi> wherein the Clergy played <hi>Rex,</hi> they grew ſo unruly that in a ſhort time they had committed above a hundred murders. To prevent this evill the King loth to enter the Liſt with the Clergy about too many matters, let looſe the law of feude for the friends of the party ſlaine to take revenge; and this coſt the blood of many Clerkes: the Laity happly, being more induſtrious therein then otherwiſe they would have been, becauſe the Eccleſiaſticall Judge for the moſt part favoured them. As an expedient to all which this Law was made, and ſo the Clergy was ſtill left to their Clergy, and juſtice done upon ſuch as ſought their blood.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient Law of the Saxons, and either by neglect worne out of uſe, or by the valour of the Clergy laid aſide,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:152542:113"/> as reſolving rather to adventure their own blood, then to end their quarrell before the Lay Judge by plea; but grown weary of that courſe, and likely alſo put hard to the pinch upon complaints made by them againſt Clerkſlayers, they are faine to have recourſe to their ancient priviledge.</p>
               <p>Hitherto therefore its manifeſt the Clergy were in their growing condition, notwithſtanding the policy and power of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, who was the paragon of that age.</p>
               <p>After him reigned <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt, that muſt expiate his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his father by obedience to his ghoſtly father the Pope in undertaking the holy warre; and being gone, left the government in his abſence ſo deeply intruſted to the Clergy, as they could looſe nothing of what they had gained, unleſſe they would; and might have gained much more then they did or ſhould; had not the Biſhop that was the overſeer of the whole Kingdom being drunken with vanity, and ſpued out his own ſhame. However the ſucceſſe was, it was not contrary to the principles of thoſe times: for <hi>Richard</hi> had experience in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Frederick</hi> and his fathers example, that the Pope &amp; Clergy were too hard for all the Potentates in <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore might moſt ſafely truſt them with all he had at home, whiles he was in their ſervice abroad. Nor were they ſhort of what was intruſted to them, but ſtook cloſe for the maintenance of his right to the Crown, and emptied themſelves even to the very conſecrated Veſſels, and procured the Laity of all ſorts to doe the like, to ſave the Kingdome from the rape of ſtrangers and uſurpers, who eſteemed the King dead in Law, and as one buried alive.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed they to King <hi>John</hi> the government, ſuppoſing themſelves well enough aſſured of what they had gotten by their ſeverall atchievements had under the reignes of three ſeverall Kings ſucceſſively: and King <hi>John</hi> might well enough have underſtood the times if he had ſeriouſly conſidered them; but being heigthned all his life time with lawleſſe government, wherein he was trained up in <hi>Ireland;</hi> he knew not how to ſtoop till he ſtooped ſo low as the Legates knee, and his Crown at the Popes foot; leaving an example to poſterity to beware of ſtriving with the Clergy.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:152542:113"/>
               <p>If then theſe ſparks of ambition were ſo virulent being alone, certainly in their joynt conſultations much more. They had long ſtriven now ſince the conqueſt to have exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Laity from their Synods, and about theſe daies effected it; and yet about <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time it may be ſuppoſed the thing either was not yet done, or ſo lately that the Law was not cleare in that point; for <hi>Petrus Blecenſis,</hi> who was Archdeacon of <hi>Bath</hi> about thoſe times, in his Epiſtle to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> concerning the reſtraint of the growing ſect of the Publicans, he adviſeth in theſe words, <hi>Accipite clerum, congregate populum, &amp; ex eorum communi deliberatione, qui ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Domini habent, terribilis conſtitutio promulgetur, &amp;c.</hi> and if the Hiſtorian doth not miſtake; the proceedings againſt that ſect being onely for errours in Religion, was in a Councell of Biſhops and Lords. Nevertheleſſe, whether preſent or abſent the Laity ſate there as cyphers, making the number great, but not valuable by themſelves. For even in the Norman times they were brought ſo low as the conſtitution made by the Clergy wrought more upon them then civility it ſelfe can work upon profeſſours of Religion in theſe daies.<note place="margin">M. Weſt. An. 1127.</note> For it ſeems exceſſe of long haire was grown to that meaſure that the Synod cried out againſt it, and decreed that men ſhould cut their haire ſo as their eyes and laps of their eares might be ſeen, and the King himſelfe, I mean <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt ſubmitted to this cut, and made all his Knights to doe the like, and expoſed themſelves to the then odious by-names of clowns or Prieſts (like to the round heads of theſe daies) who formerly marched under the titles of <hi>criniti</hi> or Ruffians.

               <p>THe dignity of the Engliſh Crown thus deflowred by the great men was no loſſe to the common people: for as in all decays of Monarchy the great men get nothing if they pleaſe not the people, ſo the King can hold nothing if they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. And yet contented or not contented, they could not gain much; for as affaires then ſtood in the Chriſtian world the Polititians diſcourſe of three kinds of government proved idle; neither could Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, nor Democracy, attaine any ſemblable condition in any place ſo long as the Church held its deſigne apart, &amp; prevailed to have the greateſt ſhare in all, not now by the favour either of great or ſmall, but by a pretended divine right, through which they now had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their full pitch of Lordſhip in the conſciences of men. It muſt be acknowledged that this was a diſtemper in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet ſuch it was as kept humours low and reſtrained the inordinate exceſſes that in all kinds of government are ſubject to break forth; ſo as neither King, nor Lords, nor people could ſwell into larger proportion then would ſuit with the ends of the Churchmen. But to mind the matter in hand: ſomewhat the Commons gained in theſe ſtormy times: The taxes that they were charged with were rather perſwaded then impoſed upon them; and generally they were ſparing in that worke; and its noted for the honour of King <hi>Steven,</hi> that though he was ſeldome without warre, yet he not onely never
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:152542:114"/> charged the people with any tax, but releaſed that of Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guelt and acquitted the ſubject for ever of that tax, which former Kings challenged as their right; all which ſhew him to be a brave King if he was not a very rich man. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond was more heavy becauſe he had more to doe: yet finde we but one aſſeſſment which was eſcuage (unleſſe for the holy warre) which was more the Clergymens then his. <hi>Richard</hi> was yet a greater burden: his reigne was troubleſome to him, and he deſerved it; for from the beginning thereof to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could never the guilt of his diſobedience to his father be blotted out; but it was more troubleſome to the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it coſt ſo much treaſure, was mannaged by ſuch ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours (except the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesfull in moſt of his undertakings: yet never invaded the liberties of the Commons by any face of prerogative. But what wanted in him was made compleat and running over in his ſucceſſor <hi>John,</hi> who (to ſpeake in the moſt moderate ſence of his government) being given over to himſelfe when he was not himſelfe, robbed the Lords of their authority, berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church of its rights, trode under foot the liberties of the people, waſted his own Prerogative; and having brought all things into diſpaire, comes a deſperate cure; the head is cut off to ſave the body, and a preſident left for them that liſt to take it up in future ages. And thus that which <hi>Steven</hi> gave, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond loſt, <hi>Richard</hi> the firſt would not regaine, and <hi>Iohn</hi> could not; and ſo all were gainers but the Crown.</p>

               <p>The execution of the Law was done in ſeverall Courts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeverall kinds of affaires, whereof ſome concerned matters of crime &amp; penalty; and this touched the Kings honour, and ſafety of the perſons of himſelfe and his ſubjects; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſaid to be <hi>contra coronam &amp; dignitatem, &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond ſort concerne the profits of the Crown, or treaſure of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The third concerne the ſafety of the eſtates of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Theſe three works were appointed unto three ſeverall Courts, who had their ſeverall Judges eſpecially appointed to that worke. Originally they were in one, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſupream Court of Judicature, the court of Lords, whereof formerly was ſpoken; but after through increaſe of affairs by them deputed or committed to the care of ſeverall men that were men of skil in ſuch affaires, and yet retained the Supremacy in all ſuch cauſes ſtill. And becauſe that which concerned the publique trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152542:115"/> was of more publique regard then the other, the deputation thereof was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted probably to ſome of their own members,<note place="margin">Gloſſ.</note> who in thoſe daies were Barons of the Realm, and afterwards retained the title, but not the degree; and therefore were called for diſtinction ſake Barons of the Exchequer. The particular times of theſe deputations appeare not clearly out of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of antiquity; nevertheleſſe its cleare to me that it was before <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time, as well becauſe <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt had his <hi>Judex fiſcalis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c 24.</note> as <hi>Glanvile</hi> ſo frequently toucheth upon the Kings court of pleas, which cannot be intended at the court of Lords, for that in thoſe daies was never ſummoned but in time of Parliament, or ſome other ſpeciall occaſion: but more principally becauſe the Hiſtorian ſpeaking of the Judges <hi>itinerant,</hi> reciteth ſome to be of the common pleas;<note place="margin">Hoveden.</note> which ſheweth that there was in thoſe daies a diſtinction of juriſdiction in Judicatures. And it may very well be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that this diſtinction of Judicature was by adviſe of the Parliament after that the grand councell of Lords was laid aſide by Kings, and a Privy councell taken up, unto whom could not regularly belong any juridicall power, becauſe that remained originally in the grand aſſembly of the Lords.</p>
               <p>Over theſe Courts, or two of them one man had the prime title of chiefe Juſtice, who then was called Lord chiefe Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> and whoſe Office was much of the nature of the Kings Lieutenant in all cauſes and places, as well in warre as peace; and ſometimes was appointed to one part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and by reaſon thereof had the name onely of that part, and ſome other of the other parts. The greatneſſe of this office was ſuch as the man for neceſſity of ſtate was continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at the Court, and by this means the Kings court was much attended by all ſorts of perſons, which proved in after times as grievous to the King as it was burdenſome to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Other Judges there were which were choſen for their learning and experience, moſt of them being of the Clergy, as were alſo the under Officers of thoſe courts; for thoſe times were <hi>Romes</hi> houre and the power of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>Other Courts alſo were in the countrey, and were Vicontiel
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152542:116"/> or Cours of Sheriffs and Lords of Hundreds and corporations, and Lordſhips, as formerly; and theſe were ſetled in ſome place;<note place="margin">Hoveden.</note> but others there were which werr <hi>itinerant,</hi> over which certaine Judges preſided, which were elected by the grand councell of Lords, and ſent by commiſſion from King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond throughout the Kingdome, then devided into ſix circuits, unto each of which was aſſigned three Juſtices; ſo as the whole number of Juſtices then was eighteen. The Office was before the comming of the Saxons over hither, but the aſſignation was new; as alſo was their oath, for they were ſworne. But the number continued not long, for within foure yeeres the King redivided the land into foure circuits, and unto each circuit aſſigned five Juſtices, making in the whole the number of twenty and one Juſtices; for the Northern cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit had ſix Juſtices which the King made Juſtices of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleas throughout the Kingdome.<note place="margin">Hoveden. 337. Ibid. 445.</note> Neither yet did the firſt commiſſion continue ſo long as foure yeeres; for within that time <hi>Richard Lucy</hi> one of the Juſtices had renounced his Office and betaken himſelfe to a cloiſter, and yet was neither named in the firſt commiſſion nor in the latter; nor did the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion continue five yeers;<note place="margin">Hoved. An. 1184.</note> for within that time <hi>Ralph Glanvile</hi> removed from the Northerne circuit to that of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> as by the ſtory of Sir <hi>Gilbert Plumpton</hi> may appeare; though little to the honour of the juſtice of the Kingdome, or of that Judge however his book commended him to poſterity. I take it upon the credit of the reporter,<note place="margin">Co. juriſd. c. 33</note> that this Itinerary judicature was ſetled to hold every ſeven yeeres; but I finde no monument thereof before theſe daies.</p>
               <p>As touching their power, certainly it was in point of judicature as large as that of the court of Lords, though not ſo high: it was as large becauſe they had cogniſance of all cauſes both concerning the Crown and common pleas; and amongſt thoſe of the Crown this onely I ſhall note that all manner of falſhood was inquirable by thoſe Judges which after came to be much invaded by the Clergy.<note place="margin">Hoveden. Glanvil. l. 14. c. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more of this, but that in their originall theſe Iters were little other then viſitations of the Countrey by the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152542:116"/> grand Councell of Lords. Nor ſhall I adde any thing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Vicontiel courts and other inferiour but what I finde in <hi>Glanvile:</hi> that though robbery belonged to the Kings court,<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> yet thefts belonged to the Sheriffs Court; and (if the Lords court intercepts not) all batteries and woundings, unleſſe in the complaint they be charged to be done <hi>contra pacem Domini Regis:</hi> the like alſo of inferiour treſpaſſes,<note place="margin">Idem lib. 9. &amp; 10.</note> beſides common pleas, whereof more ſhall follow in the next Chapter as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall be.</p>

               <p>ANd hereof I ſhall note onely a few as well touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Crown as of property being deſirous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the changes of Law with the times, and the manner of the growth thereof to that pitch which in theſe times it hath attained.</p>
               <p>We cannot finde in any ſtory that the Saxon Church was infeſted with any Hereſie from their firſt entrance till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation. The firſt and laſt Hereſie<note place="margin" type="runSum">1. Hereſie.</note> that ever troubled this Iſland was inbred by <hi>Pelagius;</hi> but that was amongſt the Britons, and was firſt battered by the Councell or Synod under <hi>Germanus;</hi> but afterwards ſuppreſſed by the zeale of the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who liked nothing of the Brittiſh breed, and for whoſe ſake it ſuffered more happly then for the foulneſſe of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The Saxon church leavened from <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſpace of above five hundred yeeres held on its courſe without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by croſſe doctrine ſpringing up,<note place="margin">Hoved. 585.</note> till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. Then entred a ſect whom they called Publicans; but were the Albigenſes, as may appeare by the decree of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe opinions I ſhall not trouble my courſe with; but it ſeems they were ſuch as croſſed their way, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond made the firſt preſident of puniſhing Hereſie in this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:152542:117"/> Kingdome unders the name of this Sect, whom he cauſed to be brought before a councell of Biſhops,<note place="margin">Nubrig. l. 2. cap. 13.</note> who endeavoured to convince them of their errour; but failing therein they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them Hereticks, and delivered them over to the Lay power; by which means they were branded in the forehead, whipped, and expoſed to extremity of the cold (according to the decree of the Church) died.<note place="margin">Decret Papae Alexand. Hoveden. 585.</note> This was the manner and puniſhment of Hereticks in this Kingdome in thoſe daies; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it ſeemeth they were then decreed to be burnt in other countries, if that relation of <hi>Cogſhall</hi> be true which <hi>Picardus</hi> noteth upon the 13 chapter of the Hiſtory of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> out of which I have incerted this relation.</p>
               <p>Another caſe we meet with in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Apoſtacy,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>2. Apoſtacy.</hi> Bracton, lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> which was a crime that as it ſeems died as ſoon as it was born; for beſides that one we finde no ſecond thereto in all the file of Engliſh ſtory. The particular was, that a Clerke had renounced his baptiſme, and turned Jew; and for this was convicted by a councell of Biſhops at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was burned. So as we have Apoſtacy puniſhed with death, and Hereſie with a puniſhment that proved mortall; and the manner of conviction of both by a councell of the Clergy, and delivered over to the Lay power, who certainly proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of the Canon, or advice of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Theſe (if no more) were ſufficient to demonſtrate the growing power of the Clergy, however brave the King was againſt all his enemies in the field.</p>
               <p>Treaſon<note place="margin" type="runSum">3. Treaſon.</note> was anciently uſed onely as a crime of breach of truſt or fealty, as hath been already noted; now it grows into a ſadder temper, and is made all one with that of <hi>laeſa Majeſtas;</hi> and that Majeſty that now a daies is wrapped up wholly in the perſon of the King, was in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time imparted to the King and Kingdom, as in the firſt times it was more related to the Kingdome: And therefore <hi>Glanvile</hi> in his booke of laws, ſpeaking of the wound of Majeſty, exemplifies ſedition and deſtruction of the Kingdome to be in equall degree a<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:152542:117"/> wound of Majeſty,<note place="margin">Lib. 10. cap. 1.</note> with the deſtruction of the perſon of the King: and then he nameth ſedition in the Army, and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent converſion of Treaſure trove, which properly belongs to the King, All which he ſaith are puniſhed with death and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of eſtate, and corruption of blood; for ſo I take the meaning of the words in relation to what enſueth.</p>
               <p>Fellonies,<note place="margin" type="runSum">4. Felonies.</note> of Manſlaughter, Burning, Robbery, Raviſhment, and Fauſonry are to be puniſhed with loſſe of member and eſtate.</p>
               <p>This was the law derived from the Normans, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was the direction in the charge given to the Juſtices <hi>itinerant</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time, as appeareth in <hi>Hoveden.</hi> But treaſon or treachery againſt the oath, fealty,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 25.</note> or bond of allegiance, as of the ſervants againſt the Lord was puniſhed with certaine and with painfull deaths: and therefore though the murther of the King was treaſon, yet the murder of his ſonne was no other then as of another man, unleſſe it aroſe from thoſe of his own ſervants.<note place="margin">Ll. Hen. 1. c. 79</note> The penalty of loſſe of eſtate was common both to Treaſon and Felony; it reached even unto Thefts, in which caſe the forfeiture, as to the moveables,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 17.</note> was to the Sheriffe of the County, unto whoſe cogniſance the caſe did belong; and the land went to the Lord immediately, and not to the King. But in all caſes of Felony, &amp; of the higher nature, the party (though not the Kings tenant) loſt his perſonal eſtate to the King for ever, his free holds alſo for a yeere and a day, after which they returned to the Lord of the ſoile by way of eſcheat. It ſeemeth alſo that the loſſe not onely of chattels and goods but alſo of lands, &amp;c. extended to Outlaries (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in caſe of Felony) and the Kings pardon in ſuch caſe could not bind the Lords right of eſcheate; although it might diſcharge the goods, and the yeere and the day whereunto the King was entituled; which caſe alone ſufficiently declareth what power Kings had in the eſtates of their ſubjects.</p>
               <p>Manſlaughter<note place="margin" type="runSum">5. Manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> made not bailable.</p>
               <p>This was law in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time, although it croſſed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:152542:118"/> the Norman Law;<note place="margin">Glanvil. l. 14. cap. 1 &amp; 3.</note> and queſtionleſſe it was upon good ground: for the times now were not as thoſe in the Conquerours times, when ſhedding of blood was accounted valour; and in moſt caſes in order to the publique ſervice. And now it ſeems it was a growing evill, and that cried ſo loud, as though in caſe of Treaſon baile might be allowed, yet not in this caſe <hi>ubi ad terrorem aliter ſtatutum eſt,</hi> ſaith the authour.</p>

               <p>Fauxonry<note place="margin" type="runSum">7. <hi>Fauxonry.</hi> Glanvil. lib. 14 cap. 7.</note> is of ſeverall degrees or kinds: ſome againſt the King, others againſt other men; and of thoſe againſt the King ſome are puniſhed as wounds of Majeſty, as falſifying the Kings charter: and whether falſifying of money were in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or not I leave, or falſifying of meaſures, yet more infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour I cannot determine; but its cleare by <hi>Glanvile</hi> that falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the deed of a private perſon was of ſmaller conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at the utmoſt deſerved but loſſe of member.</p>
               <p>Inheritances may not be aliened.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">8. Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 1. Ibid. c. 5.</note>Inheritances were in thoſe times of lands or goods; for it was the cuſtome then that the perſonall eſtate (the debts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted) was diviſible into three parts; one whereof belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:152542:118"/> in right to the wife as her reaſonable part, the other to the heire, and third to the teſtator to make his will of them; and of the other two parts he could not diſpoſe by will. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lands, it was regularly true that no man could alien his whole inheritance to the diſheriſin of his heire, either by act in his life time, or any part thereof by his laſt will, without the concurrance of the heire. But of purchaſed lands he may give part by act executed in his life time, though he have no Lands by inheritance; and if he hath no iſſue, then he may alien all. And where a man hath Lands by inheritance, and alſo by purchaſe, he may alien all his purchaſed lands as he pleaſeth. If the lands be holden in Gavel kinde, no more of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can be conveyed to any of the children, then their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable parts will amount unto. This law of inheritance was divers according to the tenure, for the lands in Knight-ſervice alwaies diſcended to the heire; but ſuch as were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in ſoccage paſſed according to the cuſtome, either to the eldeſt or to the youngeſt, or to all equally. And thus ſtood the generall ſtate of inheritance from the Normans times hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto,<note place="margin">Ll. Hen 1. c. 88.</note> ſeeming ſomewhat too ſtrait for the free men that by law of property might challenge a power to doe with their own as they pleaſed. But the Normans ſaw a double preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice herein; the firſt was the danger of ruine of many of their families who now ingrafted into the Engliſh ſtocke; and yet not fully one might expect a late checke to their preferments from the Saxon parents after a long and faire ſemblance made of their good will. The ſecond prejudice was the decay of their Militia, which was maintained by riches more then by multitude of men, partly becauſe that rich men are moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of offending, and therefore ordinarily are moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both with their bodies and eſtates againſt publique dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and partly becauſe by their friends and allies they bring more ayd unto the publique, by ingaging them in the common cauſe, that otherwiſe might prove unſenſible, of the condition of their Country.</p>
               <p>The heire of a free man ſhall by deſcent be in ſuch ſeiſm as<note place="margin" type="runSum">9.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:152542:119"/> his anceſter had at the time of his death,<note place="margin">Vide Glanv. l. 7. c, 9.</note> doing ſervice and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing releif; and ſhall have his chattailes.</p>
               <p>If the heire be under age the Lord ſhall have the Wardſhip for the due time, and the wife her Dower, and part of the goods</p>
               <p>If the Lord withhold ſeiſin the Kings Juſtice ſhall trie the matter by twelve men.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe branches is declaratory of a ground of common law; but being applied to the laſt is an introduction of a new law of triall of the heires right by Aſſize of Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danceſter, where formerly no remedy was left to the heire, but a Writ of right. If theſe three branches be particularly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they ſpeake of three ſorts of heires, of tenants by Knight-ſervice, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are majors, or of full age; and ſuch as are minors, or under age; and ſuch as are of a doubtfull age. Thoſe that are of full age at the death of their anceſtors may poſſeſſe the lands deſcended, and the Lord may not diſſeiſe him thereof; but may be reſiſted by the heire in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his poſſeſſion, ſo as he be ready to pay reliefe, and doe ſervice that is due; and if the Lord expell him he ſhall have remedy by Aſſize. Thoſe heires that are minors ſhall be under the Lords guardianſhip till they come to one and twenty yeeres. Tbe heires of ſuch as hold by ſoccage are ſaid to be at full age at fifteene yeeres, becauſe at that age they were thought able to doe that ſervice: but the ſonnes of Burgeſſes are then ſaid to be of full age when they have ability to mannage their fathers calling, ſuch as telling of money, meaſuring of cloath, and the like: yet doth not <hi>Glanvile</hi> or any other ſay that theſe were their full age to all purpoſes; albeit that ſome Burroughs at this day hold the laſt in cuſtome to all intents whatſoever. The laſt branch provideth the remedy to recover to the heire his poſſeſſion in caſe it be detained, either through doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of age of the heire, or his title; and it directs the iſſue to be tried by twelve men. This triall ſome have thought to be of <hi>Glanvils</hi> invention; and it may well be that this triall of this matter as thus ſet down was directed by him; yet he uſeth often in his booke the word <hi>ſolet,</hi> and in his preface
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:152542:119"/> ſaith, that he will ſet down <hi>frequentius uſitata,</hi> and its paſt queſtion; but that the triall by twelve men was much more ancient, as hath been already noted. One thing more yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, concerning the widdow of the tenant, whoſe dower is not onely provided for, but her reaſonable part of her husbands perſonall eſtate. The originall hereof was from the Normans, and it was as popular as that of Wardſhips was Regall; and ſo they made the Engliſh women as ſure to them as they were ſure of their children.</p>
               <p>The Juſtices ſhall by Aſſize try diſſeiſins done ſince the Kings<note place="margin" type="runSum">10.</note> comming over Sea next after the peace made between him and his ſonne.</p>
               <p>This is called the Aſſize of Novel diſſeiſin, or of diſſeiſins lately made. It ſeems that the limitation was ſet for the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſake, who now were appointed to that worke, which formerly belonged to the County courts;<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 13. cap. 33.</note> and to prevent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments of Courts, a limitation was determined, although the copy ſeemeth to be miſtaken, for the limitation in the writ is from the Kings laſt voyage, or going into <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſtices ſhall doe right upon the Kings writ for halfe a<note place="margin" type="runSum">11.</note> Knights fee, and under, unleſſe in caſes of difficulty, which are to be referred to the King.</p>
               <p>The Juſtices <hi>itinerant</hi> ended the ſmaller matters in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, the other were reſerved to the King in his bench.</p>
               <p>Juſtices ſhall inquire of Eſcheates, Lands, Churches, and<note place="margin" type="runSum">12.</note> women, in the Kings gift: And of Caſtle guard, who? how much? and where?</p>
               <p>So as the Judges <hi>itinerant</hi> had the worke of Eſcheators; and made their circuits ſerve as well for the Kings profit as Juſtice to the ſubjects. They uſed alſo to take fealty of the people to the King at one certaine time of the yeere, and to demand homage alſo. Theſe matters of the Kings Exchequer made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Judges leſſe acceptable, and it may be occaſioned ſome kind of oppreſſion. And as touching Caſtleguard, it
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:152542:120"/> was a tenure in great uſe in theſe bloody times, and yet it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth they uſed to take rent inſtead of the perſonall ſervice; elſe had that enquiry (how much?) been improper.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">13.</note>Of a tenants holding, and of ſeverall Lords.</p>
               <p>That one man may hold ſeverall lands of ſeverall Lords, and ſo owe ſervice to them all is ſo common, as nothing can be more: nevertheleſſe it will not be altogether out of the way to touch ſomewhat upon the nature of this mutuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between Lord and Tenant in generall, that the true nature of the diverſity may more fully appeare. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſubject of ſervice was a piece of land, or other tenement at the firſt given by the Lord to the Tenant in affirmance of a ſtipulation between them preſuppoſed, by the giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whereof the tenant undertooke to performe ſervice to the Lord,<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 9. cap. 4.</note> and the Lord undertooke protection of the tenant in his right to that tenement. The ſervice was firſt by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſolemnly bound, either by oath which the Lord or his deputy by the common law hath power to adminiſter; as in the caſe of fealty, in which the tenant bound himſelfe to be true to the honour and ſafety of his Lords perſon, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſervice due to the Lord for the tenement ſo given: or otherwiſe by the tenants humble acknowledgement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe not onely to performe the ſervices due, but even to be devoted to the Lords ſervice, to honour him, and to adventure limbe and life, and to be true and faithfull to the Lord. This is called Homage, from thoſe words, <hi>I become your man Sir;</hi> and yet promiſeth upon the matter no more but fealty in a deeper complement, albeit there be difference in the adjuncts belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to each. For though it be true that by promiſe of being the Lords man, a generall ſervice may ſeem to be implied, yet in regard that it is upon occaſion onely of that preſent tenure, it ſeemeth to me that it is to be reſtrained onely to thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſervices which belong to that tenement; and therefore if that tenement be holden in ſoccage, although the tenant be bound to homage, yet that homage ties not the tenant to the ſervice of a Knight;<note place="margin">Lit. lib. 2. cap. 5</note> nor contrarily doth the homage of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:152542:120"/> a tenant in Knight ſervice tie him to that of ſocage upon the command of his Lord, though he profeſſeth himſelfe to be his man. Nor doth the tenants homage binde him againſt all men, nor <hi>ad ſemper;</hi> for in caſe he holdeth of two or divers Lords by homage for ſeverall tenements,<note place="margin">Glanv. lib. 9. cap. 1. Lib. 7. cap. 10.</note> and theſe two Lords be in warre one againſt the other, the tenant muſt ſerve his chiefe Lord of whom the capitall houſe is holden; or that Lord which was his by priority, who may be called the chiefe Lord becauſe having firſt received homage he received it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely from his tenant; but all other Lords receive homage of ſuch tenant with a ſaving of the tenants faith made to other Lords and to the King, who in order to the publique had power to command a tenant into warre againſt his own Lord. If therefore he be commanded by the King in ſuch caſes unto warre he need not queſtion the point of forfeiture;<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 9. cap. 1.</note> but if he be commanded by a chiefe of his other Lords into warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a party in which another of his Lords is engaged, his ſafeſt way is to enter upon the worke, becauſe of his allegiancc to that Lord, yet with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> of his fealty to that other Lord.<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 4.</note> But in all ordinary caſes tenants and Lords muſt have regard to their ſtipulation, for otherwiſe if either breake the other is diſcharged for ever; and if the fault be in the tenant, his tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſcheats to his Lord; and if the Lord faile, he loſes his tenure, and the tenant might thence forth diſclaime, and hold over for ever. Nevertheleſſe the Lords had two privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by common cuſtome belonging to their tenures, which although not mentioned in the ſtipulation, were yet more valuable then all the reſt; the one concerning matter of profit, the other of power: That of profit conſiſted in ayds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. The ayds were of three kinds:<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 8.</note> one to make the Lords eldeſt ſonne Knight, the other to marry his eldeſt daughter; the third to helpe him to pay a reliefe to his Lord Paramont; which in my opinion ſounds as much as if the tenants were bound by their tenures to ayd their Lord in all caſes of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary charge (ſaving that the Lord could not diſtraine his tenant for ayd to his warre) and this according to the Lords diſcretion;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> for <hi>Glanvile</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Glanv. l. 9. c. 8,</note> ſaith that the law determined nothing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:152542:121"/> concerning the quantity or valew of theſe ayds. Theſe were the Norman waies, and ſavoured ſo much of Lordſhip, that within that age they were regulated; But that of reliefes was an ancient ſacrifice, as of firſt fruits of the tenement to the Lord, in memoriall of the firſt Lords favour in conferring that tenement;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and it was firſt ſetled in the Saxons time. The Lords priviledge of power extended ſo farre as to diſtraine his tenants into his own Court to anſwer to himſelfe, in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that concerned his right; and ſo the Lord became both Judge and party, which was ſoon felt and prevented, as ſhall appeare hereafter. Another priviledge of the Lords power was over the tenants heire after the tenants death, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the body during the minority and marriage of the ſame. As touching the diſpoſing of the body, the Lord either retained the ſame in his own power,<note place="margin">Glanv. 7.10.</note> or committed the ſame to others; and this was done either <hi>pleno jure,</hi> or rendring an account.<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 12.</note> As concerning the marriage of the females that are heires, or ſo apparent: the parents in their life time cannot marry them without the Lords conſent; nor may they marry themſelves after their parents death without the ſame; and the Lords are bound to give their conſent, unleſſe they can ſhew cauſe to the contrary. The like alſo of the tenants wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that have any dowry in the lands of ſuch tenure. And by ſuch like means as theſe the power of the Barons grew to that height, that in the lump it was too maſſie both for Prince and Commons.</p>

               <p>It is a received opinion, that at the common law no man could deviſe his lands by his laſt will. If thereby it be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be againſt common reaſon, I ſhall not touch that; but if againſt cuſtome of the ancient times, I muſt ſuſpend my concurrence therewith untill thoſe ancient times be defined: for as yet I finde no teſtimony ſufficient to aſſert that opinion; but rather that the times hitherto had a ſacred opinion of the laſt will, as of the moſt ſerious, ſincere, and adviſed declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt inward deſires of a man, which was the main
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152542:121"/> thing looked unto in all conveyances, <hi>Voluntas donatoris de cetero obſervetur.</hi> And therefore nothing was more ordinary then for Kings in theſe times as much as in them did lie to diſpoſe of their Crowns by their laſt Will.<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1216. Hoveden. An. 1199. Malmsb. nov. l. 1.

If then things of greateſt moment under Heaven were ordinarily diſpoſed by the laſt Will, was it then probable that the ſmaller free holds ſhould be of too high eſteem to be credited to ſuch conveyances? I would not be miſtaken, as if I thought that Crowns and Empires were at the diſpoſall of the laſt will of the poſſeſſour; nor doe I thinke that either they were thus in this Kingdome, or that there is any reaſon that can patronize that opinion; yet it will be apparent that Kings had no ſleight conceit of the laſt will, and knew no ſuch infirmity in that manner of conveyance, as is pretended; or elſe would they never have ſpent that little breath left them in vaine.<note place="margin">Glanvil. l. 7. cap. 1 &amp; 5.</note> I have obſerved the words of <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> concerning this point, and I cannot finde that he poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denieth all conveyance of land by Will, but onely in caſe of diſheriſon; the ground whereof is, becauſe its contrary to the conveyance of the law: and yet in that caſe alſo alloweth of a diſpoſing power by conſent of the heire, which could never make good conveyance, if the will in that caſe were abſolutely voide, and therefore his authority lies not in the way. Nor doth the particular cuſtomes of places diſcountenance, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance this opinion; for if deviſe of lands were incident to the tenure in Gavell kind, and that ſo generall in old time, as alſo to the burgage tenures,<note place="margin">Ll.

And therefore thoſe conveyances of lands by laſt will that were in and after theſe times holden in uſe; ſeem to me rather remnants of the more generall cuſtome, waſted by poſitive lawes then particular cuſtomes growing up againſt the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:152542:122"/> common rule. Its true that the Clergy put a power into the Pope to alter the law,<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1181. Hoved An. 1181. Decret. Alex. pap.

And its as true that Femme coverts in theſe daies could make no will of their reaſonable part,<note place="margin">Glanv. l. 7. cap. 5 &amp; 16.</note> becauſe by the Saxon law it belonged joyntly to the children.

                  <hi>CHAP. LXIII.</hi> Of the Militia of this Kingdome during the reigne of theſe Kings.</head>
               <p>I Undertake not the debate of right, but as touching matter of fact ſhortly thus much: that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Norman times the power of the Militia reſted upon two principles; the one the allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the common defence of the Kings perſon and honour and Kingdome; and in this caſe the King had the power to levy the force of the Kingdome, nevertheleſſe the cauſe was ſtill under the cogniſance of the great councell, ſo farre as to agree or diſavow the warre, if they ſaw cauſe; as appeared in the defections of the Barons in the quarrell between King <hi>Steven</hi> and the Empreſſe, and between King <hi>John</hi> and his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons. The other principle was the ſervice due to the Lord from the Tenant, and by vertue hereof (eſpecially whenas the liberty of the Commons was in queſtion) the Militia was ſwayed by the Lords, and they drew the people in Armes either one way or the other, as the caſe appeared to them: the experience whereof the Kings from time to time felt, to their extreame prejudice, and the Kingdoms dammage. Nor did the former principle overſway the latter, although it might ſeem more conſiderable, but onely in the times of civill peace, when the Lords were quiet and the people well conceited of the Kings aimes in reference to the publique, which happineſſe it was <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds lot to enjoy; for he being a Prince eminent amongſt Princes both for endowments of mind and of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate, not onely gained honour abroad, but much more amongſt his own people at home, who ſaw plainly that he was for forraigne imployment of honour to the Kingdome; and not onely contented with what he had in <hi>England,</hi> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked together with the Laity againſt the growing power of the Clergy, for the defence and honour of the priviledges of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:152542:123"/> the Crown, wherein alſo the liberties of the people were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: They therefore were ſecure in the Kings way, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves to be engaged unto the Crown further then they or their anceſtors formerly had been, out of pretence of ſudden extreame occaſions of the Kingdome that would not be matched with the ordinary courſe of defence. For the King (finding by former experience that the way of Tenures was too lame a ſupply for his acqueſts abroad, and that it had proved little better then a broken reed to the Crown in caſe of diſpute with the people) aimed at a further reach then the Lords or Commons foreſaw; and having learned a tricke in <hi>France,</hi> brought it over, (although it was neither the firſt nor laſt trick that <hi>England</hi> learned to their coſt from <hi>France</hi>) which was a new way of leavying of men and Armes for the warre,<note place="margin">Hoveden. 1181.</note> by aſſeſſing upon every Knights fee, and upon every free man, of the vallew of ſixteen Marks yeerly, their certaine Armes; and upon every free man of ten Marks yeerely valew their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Armes; and upon every Burgeſſe and free man of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour valew, their certaine Armes. 2. That theſe ſhould be ready prepared againſt a certaine day. 3. That they ſhould be kept and maintained from time to time in the Kings ſervice, and at his command. 4. That they ſhould not be lent, pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſold or given away. 5. That in caſe of death they ſhould deſcend to the heire, who if under age ſhould finde a man to ſerve in his ſtead. 6. That in caſe the owner were able he ſhould be ready at a certaine day with his Armes for the ſervice of the King <hi>ad fidem Domini Regis &amp; Regni ſui.</hi> 7. That unto this every man ſhould be ſworn: I call this a new way of levying of Armes and men, not but that formerly other free men and Burgeſſes found Armes, albeit they held not by Knight ſervice; for it was ſo ordained by the Conquerours laws formerly uſed: but now the King thruſt in two clauſes (beſides the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Armes) the one concerning the oath whereby all men became bound; the other concerning the raiſing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of men and armes, which here ſeems to be referred to the King onely, and in his ſervice; and this I grant may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply much in common capacity, <hi>viz.</hi> that all the power of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152542:123"/> Militia is in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. But this tricke catched not the people according to the Kings meaning: for the words <hi>ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Regis &amp; Regni</hi> ſtill left a muſe for the people to eſcape, if they were called out againſt their duty to the Kingdome, and taught the doctrine which is not yet repealed, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is not according to their faith to the Kingdome is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their faith to the King; and therefore they could finde in their hearts ſometimes to ſit ſtill at home, when they were called forth to warre: as may appeare in one paſſage in the daies of King <hi>John,</hi> who had gathered together an Army for the oppoſing of forraine power, at ſuch time as the Pope had done his worſt againſt him and the whole Kingdome; which Army was of ſuch conſiderable ſtrength, as I believe none ſince the conqueſt to this day exceeded or paraleld it: but the Kings mean ſubmiſſion to the Popes Legate ſo diſtaſted the Nobles and people, as they left him to his own ſhifts; and that in ſuch manner as although afterwards he had advantage of them and liberty enough to have raiſed an Army to have ſtrengthned himſelfe againſt the Nobles, yet the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from <hi>London,</hi> brought on the ſudden ſuch a party as the King was not able to withſtand, and ſo he came off with that concluſion made at <hi>Renny meade,</hi> which though in it ſelfe was honourable, yet loſt the King ſo much the more, becauſe it was rather gained from him then made by him.</p>

               <p>ONe hundred and ten yeeres more I have together taken up, to adde a period to this firſt part of diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Engliſh government; principally becauſe one ſpirit
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:152542:124"/> of arbitrary rule from King <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeemeth to breathe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole, and therewith did expire.</p>
               <p>The firſt that preſents himſelfe is <hi>Henry</hi> the third, begotten by King <hi>Iohn</hi> when he was in the very firſt enterprize of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that occaſioned the firſt Barons bloody warres, and which this King was ſo miſerable as to continue for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of his life and reigne; and yet ſo happy as to ſee it ended about four yeeres before he died. Although the ſoule be not ingendered from the parent, yet the temperature of the body of the child doth ſometimes ſo attemper the motion of the ſoule, that there is in the child the very image of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mind: and this <hi>Henry</hi> the third lively expreſſed, being ſo like unto his father <hi>Iohn</hi> in his worſt courſe, as if his fathers own ſpirit had entered into him, and animated him in all his waies. He brought in with him the firſt preſident of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in poynt of ſucceſſion by inheritance in the Engliſh Throne; for the ſtreame of probabilities was againſt him. He was a child, and the times required a compleat man, and a man for warre: He was the child of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoſe demerits of the State were now freſh in the minds of all men. He was alſo deſigned to the Throne by his fathers laſt Will,<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1216.</note> which was a dangerous preſident for them to admit, who had but even now withſtood King <hi>Iohns</hi> depoſiting of the Crown in the Popes hands, as not being in the power of a King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to diſpoſe of his Crown according to his own will. Yet leaping over all theſe conſiderations, and looking on <hi>Henry</hi> the third as the child of a King, that by good nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might prove a wiſe and juſt King: they cloſed about this ſparke, in hope it might bring forth a flame whereby to warme themſelves in ſtormy times. Nor did their hopes ſoon periſh; for during his minority the King was wiſe to follow good councell, and by it purged out all the ill humours that the kingdome had contracted in the raſh diſtempers of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers government: Nor did he onely follow the counſels of others herein, but even at ſuch times as their counſels croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he choſe thoſe councels that ſuted with the moſt populer way; as is to be ſeen in the different counſels of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:152542:124"/> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>William Briware.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1223.</note> And yet two things troubled much thoſe times: one that they were times of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the other, that the Protector was ſomewhat too excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to be a meere ſervant; and its hard for the Engliſh Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to endure him to be greater; although it may ſeem reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that they that are thought worthy to governe a King ſhould be much more worthy to governe themſelves. But the Pope put an end to all occaſion of queſtion hereabout; for by his briefe he declares the King to be ſixteen yeeres old, and of age to govern himſelfe; and therefore all Caſtles are forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be rendred up into the Kings hands.<note place="margin">M. Paris. An. 1223, 1224.</note> This proved the rock of offence, whiles ſome obeyed the Pope, and were impugners of thoſe that put more confidence in the Caſtles then in the Kings good nature. Hence firſt ſprang a civill broyle, thence want of money, then a Parliament; wherein the grand charter of <hi>Englands</hi> liberties once more was exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for a ſumme of money. Thus God wheeled about ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. But the King having paſſed over his tame age under the government of wiſe Councellors, and by this time begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to feele liberty, it was his hard condition to meet with want of money; and worſe, to meet with ill Councellors, which ſerved him with ill advice, that the grand Charter would keepe him down, make him continually poore, and in ſtate of pupilage: to this giving credit, it ſhaped an Idea in his mind that would never out for forty yeeres after; and thus adviſed he neglects his own engagement, defies the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that by his Royall word, and the Kings his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in coole blood had been ſetled; and that he might doe this without check of conſcience, he forbad the ſtudy of the law, that ſo it might die without heire, and he have all by Eſcheat. This ſadded the Engliſh, and made them drive hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily; the King (to adde more ſtrength) brought in forrainers and forraine Councels; and then all was at a ſtand. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were for new waies. The great deſigne was to get money to ſupply the Kings wants; and as great a deſigne was to keepe the King in want: otherwiſe it had been eaſie for thoſe at the helme to have ſtopped the concourſe of forrainers (other then
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152542:125"/> themſelves) from abroad; the confluence of the Queenes poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer alies, laviſh entertainment, profuſe rewards, cheates from <hi>Rome,</hi> and all in neceſſitous times. But ſtrangers to maintaine their own intereſts muſt maintaine ſtrangeneſſe between the King and his ſubjects; to ſupply therefore theſe neceſſities all ſhifts are uſed, as revoking of Charters, diſplacing of Officers, and fining them, Afforeſtations with a traine of oppreſſions depending thereon, fines and amercements, corrupt advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, loanes, and many tricks to make rich men offenders, eſpecially projects upon the City of <hi>London.</hi> Nevertheleſſe all proved infinitely ſhort of his disburſements, ſo as at times he is neceſſitated to call Parliaments, and let them know his wants. At the firſt the people are ſenſible and allow ſupply; but after by experience finding themſelves hurt by their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the King, they grant upon conditions of renewing the power of the great Charter; and many promiſes paſſe from the King to that end, and after that oathes, and yet no performance; this makes the people abſolutely deny ſupplies. Then the King pretends warres in <hi>France,</hi> warres in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and wars againſt the Infidels in the <hi>Holyland,</hi> whither he is going: the people upon ſuch grounds give him ayds; but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all but pretences, or ill ſucceſſe of ſuch enterpriſes, they are hardned againſt ſupplies of him for the holy warre: then he ſeems penitent, and poures out new promiſes, ſealed with the moſt ſolemne execration that is to be found in the wombe of ſtory, and ſo punctually recorded, as if God would have all generations to remember it as the ſeale of the covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>England</hi> and his people, and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit it.</p>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:152542:126"/> in writing under ſeale, preſerved to poſterity; vindicated by God himſelfe in the ruin of ſo many oppoſers. And yet the duſt of time hath almoſt buried this out of the thoughts of men; ſo as few even of ſuch as know it do ſeriouſly conſider how far it may yet and even now be charged upon the account of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Serious as it was, it was ſoon forgotten: nor would the King be long holden with promiſes, ſome unhappy Starre ſtrooke him in his birth; he had been too hard for his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and now having the Pope at his elbow, he can diſpence with his oath, and bid defiance to an execration; and in flat defiance of the grand Charter profeſſeth oppreſſion, accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates forraine Councellors, and forraine guards, contemnes his own people, uſhers in the Popes extortions upon them to fill up the meaſure; thrives in nothing but in the match of his ſonne and ſucceſſour with a ſiſter of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and yet that alſo helps to haſten on the publque poverty, and that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that brought forth a bloody iſſue; although not by any naturall power, but occaſionally: For the Barons mean now no longer to truſt to promiſes; ſtrangers are baniſhed the Realme, and others of the Engliſh blood ſtepped into their places and Revenues. But this was not all, the King muſt confirme the grand Charter, and thereto he addeth not onely his own oath, but cauſeth the Prince his ſonne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame in like manner. It is likewiſe propounded to him that the chiefe Officers of the Kingdome may be choſen ſuch as the Parliament ſhall like of: And that other lawes meet for the government of the Kingdom might be eſtabliſhed; of all theſe the King made no bones. And to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was in good earneſt, he was contented to diſrobe and diſarme himſelfe,<note place="margin">Dan.</note> and inveſt the Barons both with Sword and Scepter, retaining nothing but the Crown for himſelfe. This had been ſafety enough for the Kingdome, but that it was a concluſion without an agreement; for as it was on the Kings part made from a principle of ſhame and feare, ſo it was determined in anger; for after that the King had been thus dreſt and girt for the ſpace of foure or five yeeres (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he thought all the while its no matter) he began firſt to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152542:126"/> ſtretch his conſcience, and having the Popes diſpenſation to helpe, ſoon makes his oath to flie aſunder (although his ſonne had for the preſent more conſcience.) But the other girt held more ſtoutly, for the Lords had the Sword chained to their arme by the Kings own grant. <hi>Liceat omnibus in regno noſtro contra nos inſurgere &amp; ad gravamen noſtrum opem &amp; operam dare ac ſi nobis in nullo tenerentur;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. An. 1258.</note> and the Lords maintained their hold, though not without ſome jealouſies amongſt themſelves; &amp; its very probable had the King been a little longer breathed with patience, he might have had his will upon eaſier termes: for the Lords were not ſo jealous of one another as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were jealous of the Lords, that they meaned to rule one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for themſelves. But the King being now in a wood, and bemired, ſo as he muſt now reſolve to get all, or loſe all, and ſo either ſacrifice his naturall deſires, or the remainder of his politicke power, entered the field with the ayd of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that choſe rather to be oppreſſed by one King then many Lords: and thus the Lords received the firſt blow, and gave the firſt foile: afterwards being worſted by their own diviſions and jealouſies, they left a victory to the King that might have made him abſolute, if he had been moderate; but purſuing revenge too farre, he was diſtaſted of his own party that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him as a Polyphemus that intended to devoure the enemy firſt, that he might more freely feaſt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the iſſue: this made victory follow the King a farre off, and taught the King that the end of civill warre muſt be attended with moderation in the Conquerour, ſo farre as may ſtand with publique ſafety, or otherwiſe he that is conquerour to day by Sword, may be conquered to morrow by jealouſie. Thus many humours conſumed, and all parts tired after four yeeres continuall warre, the State commeth to its right wits. The Kings gaines in all this bloody ſweat may be ſummed up in two heads: Firſt, that he had liberty to chooſe his principall Officers of State by advice of the Lords, and them alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place by like Councell. Secondly, in that he gained (though at a deere rate) wiſdome to obſerve the ſtate of affaires, and to apply himſelfe according to occaſion: ſo lived <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:152542:127"/> the third for three or four yeeres after theſe troubles; long enough to let the world know that he was able to governe like an Engliſh King, and to teach his ſonne by his own late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be a wiſe governour betimes.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt being trained up in the Tragedy of a civill warre wherein he was one of the chiefe actors;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.</note> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expiated the bloody way of his riotous youth by his holy warre, as they called it; now he betakes himſelfe to amends making by juſtice in government, having found by his fathers experience that a Kingdom well governed (like good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry) preſerves the owner, but being neglected deſtroyes both.</p>
               <p>He came over in his third yeere in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> was crowned in <hi>September,</hi> ſummoned a Parliament in <hi>February</hi> following, but adjourned it till after Eaſter; and then it is found that the Church of late had been ill governed; the Clergy men grieved by many waies, the people otherwiſe handled then they ought to be, the peace ill kept, the laws leſſe uſed, and delinquents leſſe puniſhed then was meet; and in the ſence of theſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were the laws of <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> the firſt made, wherein the world may ſee the great difference between the Prince and the King in one and the ſame man.</p>
               <p>The moſt part of thoſe laws were little other then plaiſters applied to particular botches of thoſe times, wherein the King dealt with a tender hand, as if he feared to ulcerate any part, and eſpecially the Clergy, and therefore delivered the laſt law in a petitionary way to the Clergy, becauſe it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the execution of juſtice in prohibited times, and yet bound up all with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to himſelfe and his prerogative, like a wiſe King that would neither looſe right, nor doe wrong; nor yet ſtickle to debate with his ſubjects now when as his eye was upon a further marke.<note place="margin">Walſing. 46.</note> For <hi>Leolin</hi> the Prince of <hi>VVales</hi> had affronted him; and though he could not endure affronts, yet could he diſſemble them for advantage, and ſo he ſuffered the Parliament to runne its courſe, that he might have done the ſooner. Otherwiſe he had a ſeed of his fathers conceit that laws are not made for Kings, as appeared afterward: for after he had gotten his army into the field, he tooke a fifteenth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:152542:127"/> which was granted to his father, and this was <hi>inaudito more:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Weſt. An 1276.</note> but there was no diſputing with power, and therefore the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject muſt be contented rather to ſcore it up againſt the future, then require preſent pay; ſo dangerous a thing it is for <hi>England</hi> that Kings ſhould have occaſion to gather armies, though for never ſo honourable imployment.</p>
               <p>The Welſh chaſe is hotly purſued, yet it did not rid much way, for it coſt the Engliſh a voyage of nine yeeres travell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could attaine the ſhore although it had been often within their view. It may be the King found it advantagious for his government to maintaine an Army in the field under the colour of the Welſh warre, that he might more bow his ſubjects to his own bent; for during theſe warres the King made many breathings, and tooke time to looke to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of his own revenue, as thoſe Ordinances called <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta manerii,</hi> and <hi>Officium coronatoris</hi> doe witneſſe, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Bigami.</hi> But the people were not altogether yet tamed; for the times being ſtill in warres, and they occaſioning much waſte of treaſure, put the King to the utmoſt pitch of good husbandry, and one degree beyond the ſame; ſo as under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſeiſing his own he ſwept up alſo the priviledges and liberties of his ſubjects;<note place="margin">M. Weſt. Polyd. virg.</note> ſome authours reciting the complaints of the Church men, others of the Laity: ſo as it ſeemeth the King was no reſpecter of perſons, but his own. This and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not unlike had almoſt occaſioned another combuſton, had not the meeting at <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ſetled things for the preſent, by referring the right of franchiſes to debate in the Eyer, and ordering reſeiſure of ſuch liberties into the ſubjects hands, whereof they had been diſpoſſeſſed by <hi>Quo warranto</hi> and <hi>Quo jure,</hi> under colour of the fourth chapter of the Statute of <hi>Bigami.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe however debonaire the King ſeemed to be, the ſore between him and his ſubjects was not fully cured; nor did the Lords truſt him further then needs muſt, for whether they ſerved in the field or met at councell, ſtill they were armed; and during this daring of each other were many profitable lawes made, whiles neither party durſt venture bloodſhed in touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too nigh upon the priviledges of each other; principally

               <p>The wars awake againe, and therein are conſumed nigh five yeeres more of the Kings reigne, ſo as what ever his intent was, he could have hitherto little opportunity to effect any thing for the advancement of the prerogative of the Crown at home. Nor had he ſcarcely breathed himſelfe and army from the Welſh wars, but he found both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> his enemies at once. The King faced onely the firſt, and fought the ſecond; which held him work the remainder of his daies, &amp; at the ſame time alſo he arred both the Clergy and Laity at his own home as if providence had given him ſecurity for the good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and yet it failed him in the iſſue, and left him to the cenſure of the world, whether his juſtice was ſpontaneous or by neceſſity; for as yet he held the grand Charter at parley, and therefore was rather eyed then much truſted: Albeit he was put upon confidence in the ſubjects diſcretion for ayd of him in his continuall undertakings; nor did they diſclaime him herein, however chargable it was; for all ſeem willing he ſhould be imployed any where, ſo as not within the foure Seas.</p>
               <p>Its probable the King knew it, and therefore having made a voyage into <hi>France</hi> he changed the Scene of warre, but to the other ſide as it were of a river, in hope his Lords would follow; but it would not be; this angred him, and he them: nor would his Clergy allow him any ayd <hi>papa inconſulto,</hi> and therefore he outs them from his protection; theſe and his irregular prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for warre by ſummons not onely of his Knights, but all other that held Land worth 20 li. <hi>per annum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Walfing. 69.</note> and taxes impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an arbitrary way increaſed rancour into a kind of ſtate ſcoule, little better then a quarrell: for appeaſing whereof the King granted a conſultation upon a prohibition, and unto both Clergy and Laity a confirmation of the grand Charter at the long runne, and allowed it as the common law of the Kingdome, and ſeconded the ſame with many ſucceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations in the 27,<note place="margin">25 Edw. 1.</note> 28 yeeres of his reigne, as if he had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly renounced all thought of a contrary way; but the Stat. in his 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeere had a ſting in the taile that was as ill as his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:152542:129"/> ſaving of ancient ayd and priſals which was in the Stat. of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Charters, though it were omitted in this Stat. for the ſaving was of ſuch a ſence as time and occaſion would move the Kings heart to make it; and thus this Statute became like a <hi>Hocus pocus,</hi> a thing to ſtill the people for the preſent, and ſerve the Kings turne, that he might more freely intend the conqueſt of the Scots; which once done, he might if he would try maſteries with <hi>England.</hi> But God would not have it ſo; the King in <hi>Scotland</hi> had power to take, but could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and the Scots like birds of the prey had wit enough to fly away, and courage enough to return upon advantages: and ſo the King was left to hunt the wind, which made him to return.</p>
               <p>He might now expect the applauſe of his people for his good ſucceſſe, and the terrour of thoſe that had ſtopped the broad way of his extravigant prerogative; and therfore looks bigge, rubs up old ſores, and (having his Army yet in the field) ſends for thoſe Lords that would not follow him in his warres in <hi>Flanders:</hi> all come and ſubmit, and as it were in ſo many words let the King know that all <hi>England</hi> is now tame, and like to be ridden at his diſcretion. And now there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his way but the fatall execration which he feared, not in relation to Gods anger; but rather to the exaſperated Clergy, and the dread of the Popes direfull thunderbolt. To avoyd this ſtorm he procures a diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and oppreſſe without ſinne. A tricke that he learned of his father, and hid it within his breaſt till now about two yeeres before his end he brings it forth to tell all the world that hitherto he had been juſt againſt his will. But having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his purpoſe he nevertheleſſe miſſeth of his end, for a new King of Scots our old good enemies by divine providence ſuddenly croſſed his way before him, and now it boots not to contend for arbitrary rule in <hi>England,</hi> and loſe the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he once thought he had ſure; he faces about therefore, and having ſpoken faire to his people, for <hi>Scotland</hi> he goes. Thus if all were not in a parentheſis the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a good period, but God onely knowes what his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt reach would have been if he had returned, for he was
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152542:130"/> taken out of this world in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo left this his government ſomewhat like an imperfect ſentence.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>His ſonne <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould have compleated it, but that he wanted his fathers ſence, and had too much of his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuperbient humour, that meeting with a ſtiffe ſpirit, and a weak mind brought ſudden fire into the courſe of government till it conſumed it ſelfe in its own flame. For this King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving newly ſlipt out of a bondage of wiſe government under his father, ranne the wilde chaſe after raſh deſires, ſpending his former time in inordinate love, and his later time upon revengefull anger, little inferiour to rage, and ſo in his whole government was ſcarce his own man. His love was a preſident of a ſtrange nature, that commanded him from all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of his Kingdome to ſerve one man, a ſtranger, and proſtitute to all manner of licentiouſneſſe; meerely for ſome perſonall endowments. It ſhews that his judgement was weak, and his affections ſtrong; and in that more weake, becauſe he diſcovered it before he was crowned: like ſome of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of the weaker ſex, the birth of whoſe minds are borne as ſoon as they are conceived, and ſpeake as ſoon as they are borne. Its true that bravery of Spirit may worke after abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſſe in Kings under the colour of ſome kind of wiſdome. But it is one thing to rule without law, and another to live without rule; the one daſhes againſt the law of an Engliſh King, and may put on the name of policy, but the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the law of mankind, and can beare no better name then of brutiſh deſire.</p>
               <p>All the while <hi>Gaveſton</hi> was in view we finde nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning common weale or monument of Parliament, ſaving two Ordinances made by the King and ſuch Lords as ſuted to the Kings way rather then to his wants.<note place="margin">1. Edw. 2.</note> The firſt was that <hi>de militibus,</hi> the other <hi>de frangentibus priſonam;</hi> for all the Kings labour was to royallize <hi>Gaveſton</hi> into as high a pitch as he could, and ſo to amaze his own eye ſight with contemplating the goodlineſſe of his perſon. So as <hi>Gaveſton</hi> is become the image of the King, and preſents his beames and influence into all parts of the Kingdom, and according to his aſpect they often
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:152542:130"/> change and waine, &amp; yet at the beſt were but as in a miſty night</p>
               <p>The Barons liked not this condition of ſtate Idolatry; they were willing to adore the King, but they could not bow to an image: they deſired nothing more then that their King might ſhine in his proper glory. Thrice is <hi>Gaveſton</hi> baniſhed, thrice he returnes; the laſt occaſioned another civill warre, wherein <hi>Gaveſton</hi> loſt his head; thus the Lords removed the eclipſe, but (little the better thereby) they finde it a vaine labour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Sunne to ſhine by force when it hath no light. Though <hi>Gaveſton</hi> be gone, the miſt of forraine councels prevaile; this was bred in the blood, fed with blood, and ended in blood. Through the glaſſe of forraine Councels all things ſeem of forraine colour; the King to the people, and the people to him. The King at length begins to ſee himſelfe undervalued, and that it began in himſelfe, ventures himſelfe into the warres with <hi>Scotland</hi> to win honour; goes with much ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, but returns with the greateſt blot that ever Engliſh King ſuffered, confounded abroad, and ſleighted at home. For the braveſt men by ill ſucceſſe are loſt in common opinion: or, to ſpeake in a higher ſtrain, where God doth not bleſſe, man will not. The King thus almoſt annihilated, catches hold of <hi>Rome,</hi> fawnes on the Clergy, paſſes to them the Ordinances of <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi Cleri,</hi> and <hi>de priſis bonis cleri:</hi> which loſt the free men no right although it concluded the Crown. And to careſſe the Commons made the Statute <hi>de vice-committibus,</hi> and the City of <hi>London</hi> likewiſe by the ſtatute <hi>de Gavelletto.</hi> But God ſaw all ſorts of men runne at riot, and ſends in upon the Nation plague, famine, and other extraordinary teſtimonies of his diſpleaſure, even to the wonderment of other Nations; and this brought a kinde of ſobriety into affaires, made all ſorts tame, and for the preſent onely prepared them for better times. For the Kings time of longing, againe is come, and he muſt have new playfellows; findes the <hi>Spencers,</hi> or rather was found of them; they grow in honour almoſt beyond the reach of the Nobles, but not beyond their envie; and are more ſecure then <hi>Gaveſton</hi> in this, that in their firſt ſprouting the Kings Councell ſerved himſelfe and them to keepe in with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152542:131"/> by making good lawes; ſuch as the Statutes at <hi>Yorke,</hi> of Eſſoines; Attaints of Jurors, Leavying of fines; and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreates into the Exchequer, &amp;c. all of them promiſing good government. The Barons nevertheleſſe like not the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> greatneſſe, and being by ſeverall occaſions exaſperated, joyne in one, and occaſion a new warre; the King aided by the Commons (who yet thought better of the King then of the Barons, whom they ſaw prejudiced rather out of ſelfe-apprehenſions, then the publique good) prevailed againſt the Barons, and made them the firſt preſident of death upon the Scaffold.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Spencers</hi> are Lords alone, thinking themſelves above reach of the once formidable Barons, and the Commons too inferiour for their reſpect. Thus lifted up they take a flight like that of <hi>Icarus.</hi> They had ſo much of the Kings heart as they could not ſpare any part thereof to the Queen, and ſhe being as loath to ſpare ſo much for them as they had, retired with the Prince to a reliefe which they brought from beyond Sea, and with whom both Lords and Commons joyn. The favourites miſſing of their wonted wings come down faſter then they aſcended, and together with them the King himſelfe, all of them irrecoverably. Thus favourites inſtead of Cement between Prince and people becomming rocks of offence, bring ruine ſometimes to all, but alwaies to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The King foreſaw the ſtorme, and thought it ſafeſt firſt to cry truce with the people, and come to agreement with them by common conſent,<note place="margin">Prerog. Reg. 17 Edw. 2.</note> for the extent of his prerogative in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine particular caſes queſtionable; and this ſummed up, become a Statute for future times to be a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> between the King and people.<note place="margin">Stat. de Homag.</note> The like agreement likewiſe was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſervices of tenants to their Lords; and an oath framed to vindicate them from all incroachments.<note place="margin">Stat.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152542:131"/> Bailiffs, or Judges to juſtice; nor directions for regulating of Courts, nor Ordinances againſt falſe moneys and weights, nor all of them ſettle the people; but they adhere to the Queen, burning with jealouſie againſt the King, and both her ſelfe and the Lords with rage againſt the <hi>Spencers.</hi> The King flies, and being forſaken of the people, the Lords, the Clergy, his own ſonne, and the wife of his own boſome, and of God himſelfe, as the moſt abſolute abject that ever ſwayed Scepter, loſt the ſame; and being made a monument of Gods revenge upon inordinate deſires in a King, and of the Engliſh people, being enraged, not long ſurviving his demiſe, he died a death meet to be forever blotted out of the thoughts of all ſubjects, but to be had in everlaſting remembrance of all Kings. For if a Kingdome or Parliament miſleads the King, at the worſt he is but miſled by his Councell; but if he be drawn aſide by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, he muſt thanke his own luſt; in the one he hath but the leaſt ſhare in the burthen, in the other he muſt beare the whole.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXV.</hi> Of the condition of the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> till the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third.</head>
               <p>NOw was prerogative mounted up to the higheſt pitch, or endeavoured ſo to be; either through the weakneſſe or power of theſe Kings, of whom the firſt and laſt had little to ground upon but their own will; and the other, I meane <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the firſt, had more wiſdome and power, but was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies diſtracted by forraine and more urgent imployments; ſo as the worke fainted before it came to its full period. The conteſt was between the King and Barons, who till thoſe daies were rather the great and richer ſort of men, then Peeres, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they alſo were of the number. I am not ſo ſharpe ſighted as to reach the utmoſt intentions of the Lords; but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152542:132"/> their pretences are of ſuch publique nature, as its plaine that if their private intereſt was wrapped up therein, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable: and I ſhall never quarrell the Lords aime at private reſpects, whenas its plaine the publique was ſo importantly concerned; and yet I will not juſtifie all that I finde written concerning their words and Actions.<note place="margin">M Paris. An. 1217.</note> The ſpeech of the E. of <hi>Cornwall</hi> to his elder brother, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>I will neither render up my Caſtle, nor depart the Kingdome, but by the judgement of the Peeres:</hi> and of <hi>Simon</hi> the E. of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> to the ſame King, <hi>That he lied, and were he not a King the Earle would make him repent his word:</hi> and of the Lords that <hi>they would drive the King out of his Kingdome, and elect another:</hi> and of the E. Marſhall to <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, that <hi>he would neither goe into Gaſcoine nor hang;</hi> &amp; ſuch other doe ſavour of paſſion (eſpecially that of the E. of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and the Lords) and may ſeem harſh and unmannerly; and yet may admit of ſome alay, if the generall rudeneſſe of the time, the Kings injurious provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the paſſions of colerick men be weighed together: Yet will not all theſe trench upon the cauſe, nor render the ſtate of the Lords too high, or diſproportionable to their place in the policy of the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> as things then ſtood I ſay it was not diſproportionable; for where the degree of a King was mounting up to ſuch a pitch as to be above law, the Lords exceeded not their places in preſſing him with their councels to conforme to the laws; and in maintaining that truſt that was repoſed in them in keeping off ſuch ſiniſter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and invaſions as might violate the laws and liberties, or hinder the currant of juſtice; concerning which I ſhall ſhortly ſtate the caſe, and leave it to the cenſure of others. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the people of this Nation in their originall was Democraticall mixt with an Ariſtocracy (if any credit be to be given to that little light of Hiſtory that is left unto us from thoſe ancient times.) Afterwards when they ſwarmed from their hive in forraine parts, and came over hither, they came in a warlike manner, under one conducter whom they called a King; whoſe power, whatever in the warre, yet in time of peace was not of that heigth as to rule alone; I meane that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:152542:132"/> whereas the Lords formerly had the principall executory power of lawes ſetled in them, they never were abſolutely deveſted of that power by the acceſſe of a King; nor was the King ever poſſeſſed of all that power, nor was it ever given to him; but the Lords did ever hold that power the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with them; and in caſe the King would not concurre the people generally ſided with the Lords, and ſo in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the King ſuffered in the quarrell. From this ground did ariſe from time to time the wanderings of the people in elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and depoſing their Kings during the Saxon times. Nor did nor could the Norman <hi>Williams</hi> ſhake off this copartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but were many times, as well as other enſuing Princes, perſwaded againſt their own minds and plotted deſires. Nor can it otherwaies be ſuppoſed where Councels are ſetled; for whereto ſerve they, if (notwithſtanding them) the King may go the way of his inordinate deſire? If the Lords then did appeare againſt theſe Kings whereof we treat, in caſes where they appeared againſt the laws and liberties of the people; it was neither new, nor ſo heinous as its noiſed, for them who are equally if not more intruſted with the Common-wealth then the King (by how much the Councellors are truſted more then the councelled) to be true, for the maintenance of their truſt in caſe the King ſhall deſert his. But the greater queſtion is concerning the manner by threats and warre. Its as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I grant that the Lords uſed the one as the other, for it was the common vice of the times to be rugged; yet if we ſhall adde to what hath been already ſaid, firſt, that Knight ſervice was for the defence of the kingdome principally. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the greateſt power of Knight ſervice reſted with the Lords, not onely in propriety and ownerſhip, but in point of direction for the benefit of the Common-wealth; and laſtly, that the ſtate of the times now was ſuch as the kingdome was oppreſſed by ſtrangers counſels, and the Councels of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome rejected; that inſtead of law, gariſons of ſtrangers ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that no man could own his own, that the ſubjects were looked upon as enemies; and of all this the King made the principall inſtrument, who had ruled and over-ruled in this

Albeit it cannot be denied, that more due reſpects might have been tendred to kingly dignity then was in thoſe times practiſed: And yet there was a difference alſo in the occaſions of warre, for certainly that laſt warre with <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſecond was more fatall, and yet leſſe warrantable; and in the iſſue declared that there was more of the Queene therein then of the Lords, who knew a way of removing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites from the King, without removing the King from the kingdome, or driving him out of the world. In all which nevertheleſſe it cannot be concluded that the Lords party was increaſed more then in the former Kings times; for the loſſe of the field in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time againſt the Prince, kept them in awe all the ſucceeding reigne (although they were not then tongue tied) and their ſecond loſſe againſt <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, which was yet more ſharpe, queſtionleſſe quelled their ſpirits (although they loſt no right thereby) and increaſed the Kings party much by the acceſſe to the Crowne of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of ſuch as held of thoſe Lords that were attainted or diſinherited: And yet by a hidden providence the King was little the better when it came to the pinch; for when <hi>Edward</hi> the ſeconds Queen came from beyond the Seas, though with but a ſmall force, all forſake the King; neither regarding the former terrour of the Army of a King, nor the right of ſervice, nor oath of fealty, nor promiſes, nor lawes, nor other ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſo the King becomes a prey to an enraged woman, or which is worſe to a jealous wife: ſo little can the name of a King doe, when his perſon is deſpiſed; and ſo vaine for him to truſt in his Militia, that hath already diſarmed himſelfe of the hearts of his Subjects. The ſumme then of all the labours of the Nobles during theſe times will reſt in this, that they won the day, and yet loſt the field: although they loſt their own bloods and eſtates, yet they ſaved all to the people, and left laws in force able to debate with prerogative in the hand of any King that ſhould ſucceed. Thus ſtood the matter in fact upon ſuch grounds as it had, the validity whereof its not my worke
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152542:134"/> to cenſure neither by the ballance of Law or Goſpell, but leave it as a ſore time, that ſcarce will indure touch; nor beare a King further then he was good or brave.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXVI.</hi> Of the ſtate of the Engliſh Clergy untill the time of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third: and herein concerning the Statute of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis, Articuli Cleri,</hi> and of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels and nationall Synods.</head>
               <p>IT was a time of much action throughout the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State; and <hi>Rome</hi> now having attained to its full glory, began to be eyed on all parts, as an irregular motion croſſing all affaires, that it may like the ſole Empreſſe command all, and be controlled by none; and this wrought ſome ſtirrings in <hi>France,</hi> complainings in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris. 720.</note> and facing between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Pope. How chargable this was to the Popes treaſury its not materiall, but it occaſioned or was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be the occaſion of all the intolerable exactions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing; there being ſcarce one yeere paſſed over without ſome extraordinary exaction leavied upon the Churchmen, either by proviſors, tenths, procurations, levies for the Holy warre, Quindizmes, benevolences, or other ſuch like; and where money was not to be had, by levies of Ornaments or of rich apparell; by intimation, begging perſwading, commanding, threatning, and in this courſe continuing till they had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced ſhame it ſelfe, and that the whole law of <hi>Rome</hi> became comprehended in this one <hi>Quicquid libet licet.</hi> In generall therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be ſaid to thrive during theſe extorting times, although <hi>Rome</hi> did; for if the Laity were pillaged by the King, the Clergy much more both by Pope and King; if the one complained the other cried, the one ſometimes found reliefe from the King, but the other was helpleſſe, for the Pope had no eares to heare,<note place="margin">M. Paris</note> not the King hands
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152542:135"/> to helpe; he neither durſt nor would croſſe the Pope, although the Clergy told him that by theſe exactions they were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed in ſuch manner as they were diſabled to doe him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for their lay Fees. Thus <hi>Rome</hi> becomes a burden to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the members weary of bearing their head. Hereafter muſt the Pope beware of falling out with Kings, for the Engliſh Clergy now though late, ſee that all is not Gold that gliſters; nor is it any great priviledge to be the Popes men further then the Pope will be a good maſter, but this was not to be expected; Popes were grown ſo excellent, as they could not amend; and <hi>England</hi> ſo enamoured of them, as its become their <hi>vere bortus deliciarum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M.

An excellent poſture of affaires, and brave preparative to diſpoſe the hearts of all ſorts for intertainment of the eaſie yoke of Chriſts government, which was now at the doore and ready to be revealed. Nevertheleſſe poore and mean as the Clergy was they had courage enough not onely to ſtickle both with King and people for their own liberties, but alſo to invade the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both of the Crown and Commons, having this advantage, that they had to doe with a King and people that were two; and themſelves well ſeconded by the Pope, that had no leſſe power in thoſe times of publique diſtraction, and was bound to ſerve the cattell well that yeelded him ſo much milke.<note place="margin">M.

The founders and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors hereby obtained a right of corody or entertainment at ſuch places, in nature of free quarter, which in the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous times of <hi>Henry</hi> the third became ſo common that every one that had power never queſtioned right, and the King above all the reſt; by meanes whereof the Church Revenues were exceedingly waſted: for remedy whereof all offenders are by this Statute made liable to fine and impriſonment, and double dammages in caſe of action of treſpaſſe; the King only excepted, againſt whom they had no defence, but would rather have wonne him to have been their defence againſt the exactions from <hi>Rome</hi> that continually plagued them.</p>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152542:138"/> Clerks therefore the Clergy will have delivered before inquiſition if demand be made; Nevertheleſſe becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment paſſed many times befor the demand came, (for by the 15 Article of the Clergies complaints foregoing, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that the Lay Judge made more then ordinary ſpeed, for feare of ſtop.) This law provided that ſuch alſo ſhould be delivered to their Ordinary, and that due purgation ſhould paſſe before the party were delivered; and in caſe the Ordinary neglected his duty herein, he was liable to a fine or amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Briton 4. fo. 11.</note> Thus is <hi>Briton</hi> to be underſtood in this point; whereas <hi>Bracton</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as are convicted, affirmeth that if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be made of ſuch as are not indicted (for of ſuch he ſpeaketh) they ought to be delivered without indictment:<note place="margin">Bracton, lib. 3. fo. 123.</note> I ſuppoſe he meaneth by the Church law, for till this Statute the temporall Judges practice was otherwiſe, as appeareth by the 14 Article of the Clergies complaint foregoing; and ſo by this Law the 14 and 15 Articles of the Clergies complaint are anſwered.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Originally the goods of the inteſtate paſſed by a kinde of deſcent to the children: afterward by a Saxon law the wife had her part; and this continued all the Normans time. But now the ſtrength of the Canon law growing to its full pitch, after a long chaſe attached the prey. In <hi>Henry</hi> the firſts time they had
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152542:138"/> gotten a taſte, for although the wife and children, or next of kinne had then the poſſeſſion, yet it was for the good of the ſoule of the deceaſed; and the Ordinary had a directing power therein, and ſo was in the nature of an overſeer, and ſomewhat more. Afterwards in the time of King <hi>John</hi> the Clergy had drawn blood: for though the poſſeſſion was as formerly, yet the dividend muſt be made in the view of the Church; and by this means the deviders were but meere inſtruments, and the right was vaniſhed into the clouds, or as the Lawyers terme it in Abeyance. But in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time the Clergy had not onely gotten the game but gorged it; both right and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion was now become theirs, and wrong done to none but the Clouds. This was not well digeſted before <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt recovered part of the morſell; and by this law declared the uſe and benefit of the deceaſed; and thus the one was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in having what he uſed not, the other in uſing what he had not.</p>
               <p>But theſe are but gleanings; the Law of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis</hi> brings in a load at once: For the Clergy being vexed with the paſſing of the Stat: of <hi>Mortmaine</hi> (whereof hereafter when we come to ſpeake of the Clergies loſſes) they make grievous complaints of wrongs done to their priviledges;<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. 194.</note> and after ſix yeeres the King is at length wonne; and paſſed a writing ſomewhat like a grant of liberties, which before times were in controverſie; and this grant if it may be ſo called hath by continuance uſurped the name of a Statute; but in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no other then a Writ directed to the Judges, in ſubſtance as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take good heed that you doe not puniſh the Biſhop of</hi> Norwich <hi>and his Clergy if they hold plea in Court Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of things meerely ſpirituall:</hi>

               <p>Its therefore neither grant nor releaſe, but as it were a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that the Clergy ſhall hold peaceable poſſeſſion of what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> had, upon this ground, that the Kings prohibition hath
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152542:139"/> no place in ſuch things as are meerly ſpirituall. So as hereby the Clergy got a judgement againſt the Crown by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and an eſtopell, upon this maxime that ſpirituall things belong to ſpirituall men, into which ranke the Kings perſon cannot come; thus thought they, but what are ſpirituall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and why ſo called? are they ſuch as concerne ſpirituall perſons, and things? this was the old way marke; but if we bring into this Category, Adultery, Fornication, Inceſt, &amp;c. we ſhall marre all. <hi>Linwood</hi> tels us that <hi>mere ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia</hi> are ſuch as are <hi>ſine mixtura temporalium:</hi> there may be ſomewhat in this though I cannot finde it; nor can I make out the ſence of the terme any other way, but to limit it to ſuch things which by common cuſtome the Eccleſiaſticall Judge had cogniſance of: for otherwiſe neither King nor law ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to be expounded by the Canon, nor was it the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Writ, Law, or Licence, (call it what you will) thus to conclude, as the particulars following will manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fornication, Adultery, and ſuch like puniſhed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the body, and ſometimes upon the purſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe crimes the Saxons puniſhed by the temporall power, as I have already ſhewed. The Normans continued this courſe if we may believe the Conquerours lawes which gave the fine in ſuch caſes to the Lord of the delinquent.<note place="margin">Ll.

And what courſe was holden in the times of King <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>John</hi> is to me unknown,<note place="margin">M.

The cuſtome therefore cannot be made good for the Clergy, much leſſe to puniſh the bodies of freemen in ſuch caſes, it being contrary to the grand Charter; never asked by the Clergy formerly, nor no complaint before now for deniall: for my part therefore I ſhall not apprehend it of a higher nature then the Kings Writ, which in thoſe daies went forth at randome, if the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the Clergies complaints foregoing be true.

                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:152542:139"/> ſo contrary to the common ſence of Parliament to give the bodies of the free men to the will of the Clergy, to whom they would not ſubmit their free holds. But the Writ proceeds in enumeration of particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reparations and adornings of Churches and Fences of Church-yards. Violence done to a Clerke, Defamation to reforme, not to give dammage. Perjury, oblations, payments of Tythes between Rector and Pariſhioner: Right of Tythes between two Rectors to a fourth part of the valew: Mortuaries due by cuſtome: A penſion from a Rector to a Prelate or Advocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt of which were under the power of a prohibition in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who was King but yeſterday, as the Articles of complaint formerly ſet down doe manifeſt. Nor had the Clergy ever better title then connivance of ſome ſuch favourites as King <hi>Steven,</hi> whoſe acts may peradventure be urged againſt Kings, but not againſt the people, unleſſe their owne act can be produced to warrant it. The learning in the Princes caſe wil (I ſuppoſe) admit of a difference:<note place="margin">Coke lib. 8.</note> for it can never be made out that the Kings Councell in Parliament was the <hi>Magnum concilium Regni,</hi> but onely the houſe of Lords; and therefore whatever paſſed in Parliament by their onely advice might binde the King, but could never reach the Commons nor their liberties. And thus the grand Charter in the firſt conception was concluſive to the King but was not the act of the Parliament, becauſe the Parliament cannot grant a Charter to it ſelfe of that which was originaly cuſtome. And therefore this law however countenanced can never be concluded to be other then a permiſſion; not onely becauſe it was never the act of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> but becauſe its contrary to the liberty of the free men; and its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all imagination that the Commons ſhould out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the protection of the Common law, and yoke themſelves, their free holds, and eſtates under the bondage of the Canons; nor ought ſuch a conſtruction to be admitted without expreſſe words to warrant it. As for the concluſion,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152542:140"/> it is much worfe, and not onely diſhonourable to the King in binding his armes from protecting his Subjects by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawes, and ſo in ſome reſpects making them outlawes: but diſhonourable to it ſelfe, whiles it makes prohibitions grounded upon Laws to be nullities by a late tricke of <hi>non-obſtante,</hi> which was firſt taken up by the Pope, then by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and by this King granted to the Clergy: and thus are all ſet at liberty from any rule but that of licenciouſneſſe. Nevertheleſſe this Law did thrive accordingly, for we finde ſcarce any footſteps in Story of any regard had thereof till it became gray headed; For it was not long ere the King ſtood in need of money, and was neceſſitated to try the good wils of the Clergy more then once: this occaſioned them to be ſlow in anſwer, and in concluſion to deny that they ſhould ayd the King with any more money,<note place="margin">Antiq.

               <p>The Canon law had an ancient claime to the Protection of Clerks both as touching their perſons and eſtates; and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo farre as they were thereby imboldned to offer violence unto others.

Its true that anciently Mils payd Tythes, but ſuch they were which were ancient and had payd the ſame by cuſtome; and ſuch as by Law in the Confeſſors time were declared to be

               <p>Whatſoever therefore their Synods in thoſe times preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the married Clergy ſeemeth by this law that they had Clergy that were married once and againe; and yet before and after the Councell were admitted as Clerks in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law. But the Generall councell interpoſes their authority, and deprives them that are the ſecond time mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of all their priviledges of Clergy. It was it ſeemeth
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152542:146"/> twenty yeeres and more after that Councell before the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>England</hi> were throughly reformed, for either ſome were ſtill <hi>Bigami</hi> at the making of this law, or as touching that point it was vaine; nor is it eaſie to conceive what occaſion ſhould after ſo long a time move ſuch expoſition, the words of the Conſtitution being <hi>Bigamos omni privilegio clericali declaramus eſſe nudatos</hi> Now whither this ſlow reformation aroſe from the defect in law, or in obedience thereto, may be gathered from ſome particulars enſuing. Firſt, it is apparent that the canons of Generall councels<note place="margin">Generall councels.</note> 
                  <hi>eo nomine</hi> had formerly of ancient times gotten a kind of praeeminence in this Nation; but by what meanes is not ſo cleare. In the Saxon times they were of no further force then the Great councell of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome allowed by expreſſe act. For the Nicene faith, and the firſt five Generall councels were received by Synodicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of this Kingdome made in the joynt meeting both of the Laity and Clergy; and during ſuch joynt conſulting the ſummons to the Generall councels was ſent to the King to ſend Biſhops, Abbats, &amp;c. but after that the Laity were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Clergy from their meetings, and the King himſelfe alſo ſerved in the ſame manner; the ſummons to the Generall councell iſſued forth to the Biſhops immediately, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to each of them, and to the Abbats and Priors in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;<note place="margin">Bineus tom. 13 Pſ. 2. pag. 674.

                  <hi>Regumque ae principum pacificationem,</hi> or any other particul r cauſe which occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally might be incerted: ſo long then as Kings had their votes in the Generall councels, they were ingaged in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their decrees; and by this meanes entred the Canon law into Kingdomes. Nor was the vote of Kings difficult to be obtained, eſpecially in matters that trenched not upon the Crown; for the Pope (knowing well that Kings were too wiſe to adventure their own perſons into forraine parts where the Generall councels were holden, and that it was thrift for them to ſend ſuch proctors that might not altogether ſpend upon the Kings purſe) allowed Biſhops and Clergymen to be Proctors for their Princes, that in the negative they might be <hi>pii inimici,</hi> and leſſe active; but in the affirmative zealous: and ſo make the way wider by the Temporall and Spirituall vote joyned in one. Neither did Kings onely ſave their purſe but they alſo made their own further advantage hereby; for by the ingagement and reſpect which theſe his proctors had in councels, they (being for the moſt part ſuch as were had in beſt eſteem) obtained better reſpect to the cauſe that they handled, and ſpeedier diſpatch.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe the caſe ſometimes was ſuch as could not expect favour, and then as the Kings temper was they would ſometimes ride it out with full ſaile, and to that end would either joyn with their Eccleſiaſticall Proctors ſome of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and great men of their Realme, to adde to the cry, and make their affaires ring louder in the eares of fame (although the Pope had the greater vote) or otherwiſe would ſend an inhibition unto their Proctors and their aſſiſtants; or an injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to looke to the rights of the Crown (as <hi>Henry</hi> the third did at the councell at <hi>Lions</hi>) and this ſounded in nature of a proteſt,<note place="margin">Foxe Mart. P<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 2. 263.</note> and (within the Realm of <hi>England</hi>) had the force of a proviſo, or ſaving. But if the worſt of all came to paſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the councell paſſed the cauſe againſt Kings without any inhibition or injunction: yet could it not bind the law of the Land, or Kings juſt prerogatives, no not in theſe times of <hi>Romes</hi> hower, and of the power of darkneſſe: For at a Synod
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152542:147"/> holden by Archbiſhop <hi>Peckam, An.</hi> 1280. the acts of the Councell of <hi>Lions</hi> was ratified, and amongſt others a Canon againſt non reſidency and pluralities; and yet neither Councell nor Synod could prevaile. for in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſeconds time an Abbat preſenting to a Church vacant (as was ſuppoſed) by the Canon of pluralities the King whoſe Chaplaine was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed enjoyned the Abbat to revoke his preſentation upon this ground <hi>Cum igitur &amp;c.</hi> in Engliſh thus:<note place="margin">Antiq. Brit. Eccleſ. fo. 209.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereas therefore that decree bindeth not our Clerks in our ſervice in regard that the Kings and Princes of England from time to time have enjoyed that liberty and prerogative that their Clerks whiles they attend upon their ſervice ſhall not be conſtrained to undertake holy things, or to be perſonally reſident on their benefices,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if this preſent law be conſidered whereof we now treat, which tooke leave to enact a ſence upon a former Canon ſo long ſince made; and (which is all one) to make a generall Councell (will or nill it) to tread in the ſteps of an Engliſh Parliament, or (which is more mean) to ſpeak after the ſence of an Engliſh Declaration that had not yet attained the full growth of a Statute,<note place="margin">30 aff. pl. 5.</note> as was then conceived; it will evidently appeare that the power of a Councell made up of a mixture of a few votes out of ſeverall nations, or the major part of them being unacquainted with the Laws and cuſtomes of Nations (other then their own) was too meane to ſet a law upon any particular Nation contrary to its owne originall and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Law. And as the voters ſent to the generall Councels from <hi>England</hi> were but few, ſo neither were the Proctors, as may appeare from this, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> out of his modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we may believe it; and to avoyd much expence, as he ſaith, did order that the number of Proctors in ſuch caſes ſhould be few: but in truth the times then were no times for moderation amongſt Popes and their Officers, and therefore it was another thing that pinched; for multitude of Proctors, if their number had not been moderated, might perhaps if not prevaile yet ſo blemiſh the contrary party, that what the Pope ſhould get muſt coſt him loſſe of ſpirits if not blood; and although the Biſhops being faſt friends to the Pope by vertue
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152542:147"/> of their oath did prevaile in power, and the Pope had the controll of the Councell; yet the exceeding number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors on the contrary might render their concluſions ſomewhat queſtionable in point of honeſty, as being made againſt the minds of the greater number of perſons preſent, though their votes were fewer. To avoyd this difficulty therefore for more ſurety ſake the Popes enlarged the number of the voters; for whereas it ſeemeth to be an ancient rule that onely foure Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould goe out of <hi>England</hi> to the generall Councell,<note place="margin">Hoveden. An. 1179.</note> in after ages not one Biſhop could be ſpared unleſſe in caſes of great and emergent conſequence; as may appeare by the Popes letter to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the caſe required it: for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Pope began to ring ſo loud,<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1245.</note> as the holy chaire began to ſhake. Neither did Kings confine themſelves to any certaine number of Proctors, notwithſtanding the Popes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; but as the caſe required ſent more or leſſe, as unto that Councell at <hi>Piſa</hi> for the compoſing and quieting that great ſchiſme in the Popedome, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth ſent ſolemne Embaſſadours, and with them nigh eighty in all. But unto the Councell at <hi>Baſell, Henry</hi> the ſixth ſent not above twelve or thirteene, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Selden</hi> more particularly relateth.<note place="margin">Spicil. 215.</note> And unto the councell at <hi>Lions</hi> formerly mentioned the Parliament ſent but ſix or ſeven to remonſtrate their complaints of the extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> their Legates and Emiſſaries. The ſumme of all will be that the Acts of generall Councels were but councels which being offered to the ſence of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> might grow up to the degree of Lawes, if the Parliament liked them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe Nation all Synods<note place="margin">Synods.</note> in <hi>England</hi> undertooke the quarrell of Generall councels: for Archbiſhop <hi>Peckham</hi> in a Synod 1280. enjoyned the conſtitutions made in the Councell at <hi>Lions</hi> to be obſerved under a curſe without conſultation firſt had with the Parliament, or before he knew whether they would be right or wrong; and before him <hi>Boniface</hi> made conſtitutions in oppoſition to the cuſtomes of the Kingdome, ſo as the matter was now come to a kinde of conteſt whither Synods or Parliaments ſhould hold ſupremacy in doubtfull
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152542:148"/> caſes concerning the limits of the Eccleſiaſticall and temporall power: for henceforth Kings muſt bid <hi>adieu</hi> to the Synods, and ſit no more amongſt them; and Synods now thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free to conſult and determine what they pleaſe without ſpeaking under correction; nor was there other remedy left to Kings but threats, by Writs directed to the Biſhops <hi>firmiter inbibendo quod ſicut Baronias quas de Rege tenent deligunt nullo modo praeſumunt concilium tenere de aliquibus quae ad coronam Regis attinent vel quae ad perſonam Regis vel ſtatum ſuum vel ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum concilii ſui contingunt,</hi>

               <p>And this prevailed ſo farre as the Biſhops durſt not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture too farre leaſt they ſhould goe beyond their guard; and therefore they come and aske leave of the Parliament in caſes that trenched upon the Law of the Kingdom, as they did in the caſe of baſtardy, wherein they would have had their conſent that children borne before marriage to be made legittimate by the marriage ſubſequent;<note place="margin">Stat.

               <p>Nevertheleſſe the times were ſuch as Kings being too weakly aſſiſted by the people, and the Clergy ſtrongly ſeconded by the Pope, they tooke advantage of thoſe times of diſtraction ſo as to hold themſelves no further obliged to the King then the Pope and their own covetouſneſſe would allow them; and to make all ſure, they had ſetled it ſo farre as they were able by a conſtitution, that the Clergy were not bound to ayd the King <hi>Papa inconſulto;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Antiq.

The matter declares plainly not onely the oppeſſion of Lords upon their Wards, but alſo the corruption even of the law it ſelfe, that at the firſt aimed at the good of the publique, and honour of Knightſervice, but now was degenerated into the baſe deſire of profit by making market of the Wards eſtates and marriages, that brought in ſtrip and waſt of Eſtates, and niggardly neglect of the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and training up of the perſons of the Wards and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of the generation of mankind and ſpoile of times.

Now as the Lord had the tuition of the Ward inſtead of the anceſter, ſo had he the care of the marriage in ſuch manner as the anceſter might have had if he had lived. For in caſe the Ward were ſtolne and married, the delinquent ſuffered fine and impriſonment. Or if the ward married without the Lords conſent he ſhall have the double value,<note place="margin">S at.

               <p>With due regard of the opinion of others I ſhall propound my own. It ſeemeth to me that the King is within this Law, as well as within the former lawes of the Normans, and thoſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond that are of this kind; and as he is within the compaſſe of every law of this Charter, and that it is called the Grand charter as moſt immediately comming from the King to the people, and not from the Lords. Nor is there any ground that the Law ſhould intend to give liberty to widdows of Wards belonging to inferiour Lords to marry whom they will; and that onely the Kings widdows ſhall be bound: Nor did this ſuite with the conteſt between the Barons and the King, that their widdows ſhould be bound unto the King,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:152542:150"/> and the widdows of their tenants diſcharged from their tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore I conceive by the word <hi>maritagium</hi> is not meant liberty of marriage, but her marriage portion, or <hi>rationabilis pars</hi> according to the foregoing Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond; and the Saxon cuſtomes. But as touching the liberty of marriage it is defined and expreſſed that the widdows ſhall not be compelled to marry neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe if they ſhall marry they muſt marry with the Lords liking,<note place="margin">cap. 9. Glanvil. lib. 7. cap. 12.</note> otherwiſe he might have an enemy to be his tenant that might inſtead of homage and ſervice prove traytour, and be his ruine.

               <p>The Office of Judge of the Common-pleas was in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion diſtinct and ſeverall from that of the Crown pleas; nor though one and the ſame man might execute both authorities, doth it therefore follow that it was by one and the ſame power? as if being Judge, he had thereby power in all matters of the Common pleas, and alſo of the Crown: for though it be true that <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, the King hath one proper court where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are the chiefeſt Judges,<note place="margin">Capitales Juſt. noſtri.</note> which both by his own teſtimony and Britons alſo did heare and determine cauſes of all ſorts;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:152542:152"/> yet is it true alſo that it was by appeale or Writ of errour, as in caſe of falſe judgement; and that the King had <hi>plures curias,</hi>

This law therefore doth not as I conceive worke any alteration, but onely in this, that whereas formerly the Judges of Common pleas attended on the Kings Court continually, as all other Judges did; and whither the King removed they did the like, which was a great uncertainty and grievance unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

               </p>
               <p>Purveyance was ancient proviſion for the neceſſities of the publique, and ſo farre was commendable, ſeeing its not the common caſe of all men to regard the publique above their own private intereſt; therefore the publique muſt provide for it ſelfe, by their meanes in whom the publique is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: and this was in thoſe elder times, but in two caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of Kings and Caſtles; in the one of which the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is principally concerned, in the other the publique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For it may be well conjectured that Caſtles were either firſt made in places commodious for habitation, and great Towns gathered to them for their better ſafety; or that the Townes were firſt gathered in places of commodious habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then Caſtles were made for their better defence, or if they were impoſed upon them by the victor to keepe them in awe, they were nevertheleſſe by continuance together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tractable, and conſpired for the mutuall defence of each other. But as touching ſuch Cittadels or Caſtles that were ſet
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:152542:155"/> in ſolitary places, they may ſeem rather firſt intended for the particular defence of ſome particular man and his family, and neighbouring tenants; and therefore in the purveyance for Caſtles it ſeems the proper Town wherein it is, is principally liable to that duty, becauſe their ſafety is more principally intereſted; and therefore prizes there taken may be payd at a day to come; but in all other places immediately. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this laſted not long, for the ſouldiers found out a tricke of favouring their own quarters, and preſerving them in heart againſt a back winter, knowing that at ſuch times its better to ſeeke for proviſion nigh, then to be compelled to ſeeke far off. But this Stratagem was cut off by the next King, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited all manner of purveyance in any other Town,<note place="margin">Weſtm. 1. cap. 7</note> then in the ſame Town wherein the Caſtle is ſeated. This was a charge that was but temporary, and occaſionall: That which was more laſting and burdenſome upon the ſubjects was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance for the King, which nevertheleſſe cannot be avoyded, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of his retinue, eſpecially in thoſe daies; and if they ſhould have their reſort to the market, the ſame could not be free to the people, for that the firſt ſervice muſt be for the Kings houſehold, and ſo what ſcraps will be left for the Commons no man can tell. It was therefore neceſſary for the Kings family to be maintained by purveyance;<note place="margin">Artic. ſuper cart. cap. 2.</note> and to avoyd the many inconveniences which might and did ariſe in thoſe ſpoyling times, It was ordained that it ſhould be felony for any purveyor to purvy without warrant. 2.

               <p>And it ſeemeth that this law of free paſſage out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was not anciently fundamentall, but onely grounded upon reaſon of State, although the free men have liberty of free paſſage within the Kingdome according to that originall law, <hi>ſit pax publica per communes vias;</hi> and for that cauſe, as I ſuppoſe, it was wholly omitted in the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the third; as was alſo another law concerning the Jewes, which becauſe it left an influence behind it (after the Jewes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in this Nation) and which continueth even unto this day, I ſhall incert it in this ſhort ſumme.</p>

Nevertheleſſe it ſeemeth that <hi>de facto</hi> tenants did uſually alien their whole tenancy; and although they could not thereby barre the Lords right, yet becauſe the Lord could not in ſuch caſe have the diſtreſſe of his own tenant, this law ſaved ſo much from alienation, as might ſerve for ſecurity of the Lords diſtreſſe. But tenants were not thus ſatisfied; the Lords would not part with their tenants, although the tenants neceſſity was never ſo urgent upon them to ſell their Lands; and therefore at length they prevailed by the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores</hi> to have power to ſell all,<note place="margin">18 Edw. 1.

               <p>The Sheriffs Courts had now loſt ſomewhat of their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, though for time and place they are confirmed <hi>ſtatu quo;</hi> to the end that through uncertainty thereof the ſuiter might not make defaults, and be amerced; yet they loſt much of their reſpect within the compaſſe of theſe few yeeres by two laws,<note place="margin">Merton. cap. 10</note> the one of which made at <hi>Merton</hi> allowed all ſuiters to the rurall Courts to appeare by proxy or atturney, which it ſeemeth had power to vote for the maſters in all caſes publique and private; and did not onely themſelves grow into parties and maintenance of quarrels, and ſo ſpoiled theſe Courts of their common Juſtice, but rendred the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ignorant and careleſſe of the common good of the Country, and given over to their own private intereſt. And though the corruption of juſtice was ſoon felt,<note place="margin">Weſt. 1. c. 33.</note> and againſt it a law was provided, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sheriffe ſhould not allow of ſuch corrupt atturnies; yet this was no cure to the free men, who were ſtill ſuffered to wax wanton at home, albeit that they were diſcharged from doing their ſuite in all other Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds but that wherein they dwell.<note place="margin">Marlbr. cap. 10.</note> The ſecond law that tooke away much honour from theſe Courts was that law at <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>

                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:152542:160"/> that diſcharged the Baronage of <hi>England,</hi> and the Clergy from their attendance at ſuch ſervice, and this alſo opened the doore wider to oppreſſion, for where greatneſſe is it carieth therewith honour from the meaner ſort, and a kinde of aw and ſtop unto the minds of ſuch men that otherwiſe would riot without reſtraint; and though it might alſo be ſaid that the pretence of great men in ſuch Courts would overſway the meaner, and make ſtrong parties; yet it muſt alſo be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that theſe parties being greater are the fewer, and doe not ſo generally corrupt all ſorts as the corruption of the meaner ſort doe; its ſaid by the wiſe man, where the poore oppreſſe the poore its like a raging raine that leaves no food. The laſt branch in this Law is an inhibition to the Sheriffe from extortion; and ſurely there was great need, and much more need then ever now that the Lords and Clergy are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It was thought that the great occaſion of the Sheriffs oppreſſion was from above, I meane from the King that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the vallews of the farme of Counties granted to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,<note place="margin">Artic. ſuper cart. cap. 13, 14.

               <p>The Charter of King <hi>John</hi> hath ſuperadded hereunto this enſuing proviſion. There ſhall be no Eſcuage ſet in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

And for the aſſeſſing of Eſcuage we will ſummon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Earles, and greater Barons of the Kingdome, ſpecially by our ſeverall Writs, and will cauſe to be ſummoned in generall by our Sheriffs and Bayliffs all other our tenants in <hi>capite</hi> to be at a certaine day after forty daies at the leaſt, and at a certaine place; and we will ſet down the cauſe in all our Writs. And the matter at the day appointed ſhall proceed according to the councell of thoſe that ſhall be preſent, although all that were ſummoned doe not come. And we will not allow any man to take ayd of his free men, unleſſe for redemption of his body, and making his eldeſt ſonne a Knight, and one marriage for his eldeſt daughter; and this ſhall be a reaſonable ayd onely.</p>
               <p>Thus farre the Charter of King <hi>John</hi> concerning this point of taxe or aſſeſſment; and if the Hiſtory ſaith true the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the third was one and the ſame with that of King <hi>John</hi> then either this was not left out in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in that Hiſtorians time;<note place="margin">M. Paris</note> or if it was omitted in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall it was ſuppoſed to be included in the generall words of the Law, as being accuſtomed in times paſt; and then theſe particulars will be emergent: Firſt, that the ayds and Eſcuage in <hi>Henry</hi> the firſts time were aſſeſſed by the ſame way with that in this Charter of King <hi>John;</hi> for that all the quarrell between the Lords and King <hi>John</hi> was concerning the charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, which the Lords ſware to maintaine. Secondly,<note place="margin">M Paris An. 1214, 1215 25 Edw. 1. cap. 6. 34 Edw. 1. cap. 1. Weſt. 1. cap. 36.</note> that neither ayds nor eſcuage were granted, or legally taken, but by Act of Parliament, although the rate of them was ſetled by common cuſtome, according to the quantity of their fee. Thirdly, that ſome Parliaments in thoſe times as concerning ſuch matters conſiſted onely of ſuch men as were concerned by way of ſuch charge, by reaſon of their tenancy, for eſcuage only concerned the tenants by Knights ſervice; and therefore thoſe onely were ſummoned unto ſuch Parliaments as onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:152542:161"/> Eſcuage; nor had the City of <hi>London</hi> nor the Burgeſſes right to vote in ſuch caſes, it is ſaid p. 258. And thus the Forreſt laws that were made in, the time of <hi>Ri.</hi> 1. were made by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Archbiſhops,<note place="margin">Hoveden 445.</note> Biſhops, Abbots, Earls, Barons, and Knights of the whole Kingdome; for what the great men gained they gained for themſelves and their tenants. And the truth is, that in thoſe times although publique dammage concerned all, yet it was ordinary for Kings to make a ſhew of ſummoning Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, when as properly they were but Parliamentary mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ſome ſuch Lords, Clergy, and others, as the King ſaw moſt convenient to drive on his own deſigne, and therefore we finde that <hi>Henry</hi> the third about the latter part of his reigne, when his government grew towards the dregs, he having in the Kingdome two hundred and fifty Baronies he ſummoned unto one of theſe Parliamentary meetings,<note place="margin">Gloſſ. tit. Baron.</note> but five and twenty Barons, and one hundred and fifty of his Clergy. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the law of King <hi>John</hi> was ſtill the ſame, and we cannot rightly read the law in ſuch preſidents as are rather the birth of will then reaſon. Fourthly, that no ayds were then granted, but ſuch as paſſed under the title Eſcuage, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there unto; for the words are, <hi>No Eſcuage ſhall be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or granted, or taken, but for redeeming the Kings perſon, Knighting of his ſonne, or marriage of his daughter.</hi> Nor is the way of aſſeſſing in theſe times different, ſaving that inſtead of all the knights, two onely are now choſen in every County; the tenure (as it ſeemeth) firſt giving the title of that order, and both tenure and order now changed into that title taken up for the time and occaſion. Fifthly, that it was then the ancient cuſtome, and ſo uſed in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt; that the advice of thoſe then preſent was the advice of the whole, and that their advice paſſed for a law without contradiction, or notwithſtanding the Kings negative voice; for the words are <hi>The matter at that day ſhall proceed according to the councell of thoſe that ſhall be preſent, although all doe not come;</hi> and therefore that clauſe in the Kings oath <hi>quas vulgus eligerit</hi> may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the future, and not in the pretertence. Laſt of all, though not gathered from the text of this law, whereof we
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:152542:161"/> treat, yet being coincident with the matter it is obſervable that though the Clergy were now in their ruffle, and felt themſelves in their full ſtrength; yet there befell a poſture of ſtate that diſcovered to the world that the Engliſh held not the intereſt of the Clergy to be of ſuch publique concernment, or neceſſary concurrence in the government of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">Walſing. An. 1297.</note> as was pretended. For the Clergy finding aſſeſſements of the Laity ſo heavy, and that occaſions of publique charge were like to multiply daily, they therefore to ſave the maine ſtocke procured an inhibition from <hi>Rome</hi> againſt all ſuch impoſitions from the Laity, and againſt ſuch payments by the Clergy; and in the ſtrength of this they abſolutely refuſed to ſubmit to ayd <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt by any ſuch way, although all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had thereunto conſented. And thus having divided themſelves from the Parliament, they were by them devided from it; and not onely outed of all priviledge of Parliament, but of all the priviledge of ſubjects, into the ſtate of <hi>praemuniri:</hi> and thus ſet them up for a monument to future times, for them alſo to act without the conſent of thoſe men, as occaſion ſhould offer. But <hi>Henry</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. not ſatisfied with this ancient and ordinary way of aſſeſſement upon ordinary occaſions, tooke up that extraordinary courſe of aſſeſſement upon all the free men of the Kingdome, which was formerly taken up onely in that extraordinary occaſion of redeeming of the Kings or Lords perſon out of captivity, and common defence of the land from piracy; and under the title of Daneguelt, which was now abſolutly dead, and hanged up in chains as a monument of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Nevertheleſſe it cannot be denied but that in former times the free men were as deeply taxed, if not oppreſſed with payments to their Lords at ſuch times as they were charged over to the King in the caſes aforeſaid, as by the latter words of the law aforeſaid of King <hi>John</hi> doth appeare, and whereby its probable that the inferiour Lords were gainers. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the third (the fame ſuiting alſo with the third obſervation foregoing) doth not a little favour the ſame; for its expreſly ſet down that in lieu of the Kings confirmation of the Charter of liberties aforeſaid not
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152542:162"/> onely the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Earles, Barons, and Knights, but alſo the free men, and all the Kingdome gave a fifteenth of all their moveables.</p>
               <p>And thus have I ſummed up and compared both the copies of the grand Charters of <hi>Englands</hi> liberties (ſaving two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars inſerted into the Foreſt laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, wherein if any thing had been new and unreaſonable King <hi>John</hi> might have colour to except againſt them as extorted by force, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third might (as he was adviſed) plead nonage,<note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1227.</note> and ſo they might have been choked in their birth; but being all <hi>conſuetudines,</hi> as in the concluſion they are called; and Kings aſhamed to depend upon ſuch frivolous exceptions, it may be wondred what might move them to adventure ſo much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and themſelves into ſo many troubles to avoyd their own acts, unleſſe the writing of them were an obligation acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before the world; and they reſolving ſecretly to be under none were loath to publiſh the ſame to all men. Its a ſtrange vanity in great men to pretend love to juſtice, and yet not indure to be bound thereto, when as we ſee that God himſelfe loves to be bound by his word, and to have it pleaded, becauſe he delights as much to be acknowledged true in performing, as good in promiſing. But neither was King <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> the third of this ſpirit; faine they would undoe, but could not. Its true it was at the firſt but a Kings charter of confirmation, and had Kings been patient therewith it might have grown no bigger; but by oppoſition it rooted deeper and grew up unto the ſtature of a Statute, and ſetled ſo faſt as it can never be voided but by ſurrender from the whole body.<note place="margin">Marlbr. cap. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus ſummed up the liberties of the ſubjects and free men of <hi>England</hi> under this Charter, I ſhall make ſome appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix hereunto by annexing a few additionals in theſe times eſtabliſhed; and although they come not within the letter of the Grand charter, yet are they ſubſervient thereunto. And firſt concerning the King; and this either as he is King, or as he is Lord. As King he had theſe prerogatives above all Lords.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And concerning mad-men and lunaticks,</hi>

                  <hi>the King ſhall provide a Bayliſſe for their maintenance, rendring account to them when they are ſober, or to their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is no leſſe liberty or priviledge of the people that fooles and mad perſons are to be ordered by tutors then children, and therefore this may be annexed to the reſt of the liberties as well as the other. Nevertheleſſe it ſeemeth that the Laws tooke them into their regard in reſpect of their eſtates, which might be abuſed to the prejudice of the publique, rather then out of reſpect had to their perſons. Now becauſe there is a difference between the diſability of theſe perſons, the one being perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall the other temporary; therefore is there alſo by theſe laws a difference in the diſpoſall of their eſtates; for the tutor had a right in the diſpoſing of the one, and but a bare authority or power in providing for the other. Secondly, the perſon of the tutor is to be conſidered: Anciently it was the next kindred, grounded as I conceive, upon the naturall affection going along with the blood; and this ſo continued in cuſtome untill theſe times: for though the <hi>Miror of Juſtices</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt brought in that courſe of giving the cuſtody of theſe diſabled perſons to the King, as hath been formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet <hi>Bracton</hi> that wrote long after the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, ſpeaking of theſe kind of perſons ſaith,<note place="margin">Bract. lib. 5. cap. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Talibus de neceſſitate dandus eſt tutor vel curator;</hi> not ſo much as mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King in the caſe. And in another place, ſpeaking of ſuch as are <hi>alieni juris</hi> ſaith, that ſome are under the cuſtody of their Lords, and others under their parents and friends.<note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 10</note> But let the time of the entrance of this law be never ſo uncertaine, its now a declared law, that the King in ſuch caſes is the common curator or tutor of all ſuch perſons, as he is a chiefe Juſtice, rendring to every one his right.</p>

For the fundamentall ground is, that the right owner cannot be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and therefore the King ſhall hold it; and if the right owner can be manifeſted the King ſhall hold it till the owner doth appeare.</p>

And this cuſtody bringeth with it an authority or power onely, and no right, as in caſe of the heire in Knightſervice; and therefore cannot be granted over as the wardſhip in Knightſervice might, but the guardian in Socage remaineth accomptant to the heire for all profits both of land and marriage. The full age of tenant in Socage is ſuch age wherein he is able to doe that ſervice, which is 14 yeeres, for at ſuch age he may b able by common repute to ayd in tillage of the ground, which is his proper ſervice.

The worke of the Juſtices <hi>itinerant</hi> was univerſall, comprehending both matters of the Crown and Common-pleas. That of <hi>oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer</hi> is onely of Crown pleas originally commenced, and inquired of by themſelves, and granted forth upon emergent crimes of important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that require ſpeedy regard and reformation. Juſtices of Gaol-delivery have a more large worke, that is, to deliver the Gaols of all criminall offenders formerly indicted or before themſelves. Juſtices of Aſſize and <hi>Niſi prius</hi> are to have cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of Common pleas onely, and for the moſt part are but fo inquiry. All which ſaving the Juſtices <hi>itinerant</hi> in ancient uſe were inſtituted about theſe times, and therewith ended both the worke and common uſe of the ancient <hi>iters;</hi> and yet all theſe later courts joyntly conſidered have not the like compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive power that the <hi>iters</hi> had, for they had the power of hearing and determining all cauſes, both of the Crown and Common-pleas, albeit in a different manner; that is to ſay, in the firſt times promiſcuouſly united into one and the ſame perſon; but ſoon after the Norman times, and more clearly in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond that power was divided into ſeverall perſons, ſome ſitting upon the Common pleas, others upon the Crown pleas: The Judges of theſe journying courts were ſpecially aſſigned by the King, as in the caſe of the Gaole-delivery

Another and laſt court that was ſetled in this manner was the Marſhals court, which in the originall onely concerned the Kings houſhold, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards compaſſed in a diſtance of the neighbouring places,<note place="margin">5 E. 4 fo. 129.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kings attendants were many in thoſe times; when as the Courts of juſtice continually attended on his perſon: and this precinct was called the Vierge; and all caſes of debt and covenant, where both parties were of the Houſhold,<note place="margin">Artic. ſup. cart. cap. 3.</note> and of treſpaſſes <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> where one of them was of the houſhold were handled in the court of the Verge, or the Marſhals court. And inqueſts of death within the ſame ſhall be taken by the Coroner of the County, with the Coroner of the houſhold. Other Courts were rurall, and affixed alſo to ſome certaine place, either of the County or Town, or other particular place. That of the County ſuffered in theſe times great diminution, even almoſt to deſtruction by a Law reſtraining the power thereof onely to treſpaſſes of 40 s. value or under;<note place="margin">Stat. Gouc. cap. 8.</note> for though formerly the Kings juſtices incroached upon the County courts and contracted ſuits before themſelves, which by the ancient law they ought not; yet it was ever illegall, and the County courts held their right till this law was made, which kept under thoſe inferiour Courts, and made them of leſſe account then formerly. Nevertheleſſe the Kings <hi>Juſticies</hi> or Writ to the Sheriffs oftentimes inableth the inferiour Court
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:152542:165"/> to have cogniſance of caſes of greater value.

               <p>Of theſe Officers formerly hath been ſpoken, as touching their election, qualification, and worke: this Law brought in no change of any former Law, but onely of a former cuſtome gained by theſe degenerating times, which brought men into place that were farre unfit, who otherwiſe of poore and mean condition maintained themſelves by bribery and extortion, and being found guilty had not ſufficient to give recompence.

One example whereof, and the firſt that ſtory maketh mention of we finde of an Iriſh Nobleman in the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who ſuffered death for piracy; and it was a law that then, though rigorous, yet ſeaſonably was contrived to retard the beginnings and haſten the concluſion of a civill warre in a

               </p>
               <p>Before this Law this crime was but finable unleſſe the fact was committed upon a virgin, for then the member was loſt.

Nor was this made fellony by any law or cuſtome that I can finde, till about theſe daies. Its true that <hi>Canutus</hi> puniſhed it <hi>capitis aeſtimatione,</hi> by way of compenſation, which rather gives a rule of dammages to the party wronged then importeth a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted for an offence done againſt the Crown, as if it were thereby made capitall.

But if a wife be carried away with the goods of her husband, beſides action of the party the King ſhall have a fine.

All which now recited proviſoes are comprehended together in one chapter, and yet the Chapter is <hi>partee per feſſ</hi> French and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine: ſo farre thereof as concerneth death was written in French, being the moſt known language to the great men in generall, many of whom were French, by reaſon of the intereſt that <hi>Henry</hi> the third had with <hi>France</hi> in his late warres againſt the Barons. It was therefore publiſhed by way of caveat, that no perſon that underſtood French might plead ignorance of the law that concerned their lives.

               <p>It hath been accounted an extreame conſtruction of this law, and queſtionleſſe ſo it is, that this Law ſhould warrant that puniſhment of preſſing to death which hath been of later times more conſtantly uſed then former times ever knew of; for though it be granted that ſome tricke of torture was ſometimes uſed, even before the Norman times, and ſo might now and then leave ſome few examples after the Norman times, yet did the law never patroniſe ſuch courſes, eſpecially if the death of the party ſuſpected enſued thereupon,<note place="margin">Miror cap. 1. ſect. 9.</note> but accounted it manſlaughter. And the end of this law was not to put a man to death, but to urge him to confeſſe; and ſo <hi>Briton</hi> ſaith, ſuch as will not ſubmit to triall ſhall be put to penance till he ſhall pray to be admitted thereunto; and therefore the penance then uſed was ſuch as did not neceſſarily inferre death;<note place="margin">Briton cap. 4. ſect. 24.</note> nor was it a finall judgement in the triall, but onely a meanes thereto: and therefore it might rather conſiſt in deniall of convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then inflicting of paine. Now in what caſes it was uſed may be underſtood from the manner of the indictments in thoſe daies, whereof (beſides appeales by the party) ſome were of particular fact done; others onely of a fame: and it may be conceived that the courſe in the ſecond was,<note place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 10 cap. 1.</note> that if a man would not ſubmit, but would ſtand mute, he was put to this kind of impriſonment for the diſcovering law was by <hi>Henry</hi> the third taken away. But if the delinquent was poſitively accuſed of a felony, and thereupon indicted by a witneſſe of the fact, and then the delinquent would not ſubmit to his triall by law, in ſuch caſe the finall judgement was to die <hi>O nore, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe in the one there was a fact affirmed againſt him by a witneſſe, and in the other onely a fame or ſuſpition, which is not pregnant againſt the life of a man. But this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of indictment being now laid aſide, and all proceedings being upon a fact affirmed againſt the party, I conceive this law of no uſe at all in theſe daies.</p>

As touching breakers of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in theſe times it was felony, for what cauſe ſoever they were committed; and therefore their impriſonment was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baile, for who ſo makes no conſcience of breaking the priſon, his credit will little availe: yet it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the Law impriſoned few without baile in thoſe foregoing times, but in caſe of felony or execution; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the caſes of commitment being ordinary, even in matters of mean proceſſe, and becauſe mens credits waxing weake by the weakneſſe of their eſtates now waſted by the civilwars; there fore in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſeconds time a law was made to reſtrain the felony in ſuch caſes, onely to the breach of priſon by ſuch as were committed for felony. And as touching impriſonment upon excommunication, its manifeſt that within five yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of this law it was complained that ſuch were ſet at liberty by the Kings Writ <hi>de homine replegnando</hi> without the Biſhops conſent.<note place="margin">Addit.

Nor was this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint grounded upon any other law then that of the Canon, for the common law ever held the ſupreame cogniſance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication within its own power, as upon the Writ <hi>de quare excomunicato</hi> may appeare. Other crimes are yet alſo by this law allowed baile, ſuch as are perſons indicted of larceny before Sheriffs, &amp;c. perſons impriſoned upon ſlight grounds Receivers, and Acceſſories before felony, Treſpaſſers, perſons appealed by provers after the death of the approvers. If baile be granted otherwiſe, then the law alloweth the party that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the ſame, ſhal be fined impriſoned, render dammages, or
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152542:168"/> forfeit his place as the caſe ſhall require. And thus the iniquity of the times was ſo great as it even forced the ſubjects to forgoe that which was in account a great liberty to ſtop the courſe of a growing miſchiefe.</p>

Caſtles had been a bone of long contention between them, but they being for the moſt part taken away the ſtrife was about priſons and power to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offenders; and that alſo after much oppoſition they layd aſide: yet the violence of theſe times being ſuch, as (though felonies were ſomewhat dreaded) treſpaſſes of the higheſt nature were little regarded, ſuch as were riotous hunting in their Parks, and fiſhing in their waters. The Lords and great men made it their laſt requeſt that at leaſt in ſuch caſes they might have power to impriſon ſuch as they found ſo treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; but this was alſo denied them,<note place="margin">Merton cap. 11.</note> though by <hi>Henry</hi> the third in his firſt time, when as yet the government was not worſted by projects of arbitray power or corrupt counſels of forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor himſelfe a man able to ſway with the Lords in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that were of doubtfull prerogative. And to ſpeake indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently its better for the liberty of the ſubject, that the power of impriſonment ſhould be regulated onely by the Kings Writ ordered by law, then by the warrants of great men, eſpecially in their own caſes; and therefore in this matter the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative was a patron to the freemens liberty. Nevertheleſſe theſe great men give not thus over their game, for though in times of publique calamities little place is left for pleaſure to any man; yet when times are grown to more quiet, pleaſure revives, and the great men renew their motion; and though they could not obtaine priſons to their own uſe, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured at the meeting at <hi>Merton;</hi> yet now they obtaine the Kings priſons to the uſe of a Law that was as good as their own, and thereby ſatisfied their own diſpleaſure for the loſſe of their pleaſure.

               <p>Regularly all tenants by Knightſervice ought to be Knights, but <hi>de facto</hi> were not; ſo as in theſe times there was a further worke to make a man a Knight then his bare tenure; for ſuch onely were <hi>milites facti,</hi> who had both Lands ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Armes and ſtate of a Knight; and alſo a body fit to undertake the ſervice in his own perſon, and whereof he had given ſufficient proofe in the field. Others that had Land ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not ſufficient maintenance or not habiliments of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as not expected were laid aſide; of this ſort were many by reaſon of the late civill warres, in which they had much impaired both their bodies and eſtates. This rendred the ſtrength of the Kingdome and Militia ſo much decayed and the minds of men ſo weared that they began to love eaſe before the times would brooke it, and a ceſſation from Arme before they had any mind to peace. The Parliament eſpied the danger, &amp; how neceſſary it was for the people to be well armed in theſe times of generall broile; and upon that ground allowed this law to paſſe, that all ſuch as had Lands worth 20 li. yeerly beſides repriſals ſhould be ready not to be Knights (nor under the favour of others is there any ancient preſident to warrant
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152542:169"/> it) but to finde or to enter the field with the Armes of a Knight, or provide ſome able perſon to ſerve in their ſtead unleſſe they were under 21 yeeres of age, and ſo not grown up to full ſtrength of body; nor their lands in their own poſſeſſion, but in cuſtody of their Lords or guardians. Nevertheleſſe of ſuch as were grown to full age, yet were maimed impotent, or of meane eſtate, and tenants by ſervice of a Knight, it was had into a way of moderation, and ordered that ſuch ſhould pay a reaſonable fine for reſpit of ſuch ſervice; nor further as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their perſons were they bound. But as touthing ſuch that were under preſent onely, and not perpetuall diſabilities of body upon them incumbent, as often as occaſion called they ſerved by their deputies or ſervants: all which was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely upon the law of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, but alſo upon common right of tenure.</p>
               <p>The armes that theſe men were to finde are ſaid to be thoſe belonging to a Knight, which were partly for defence and partly for offence; of the firſt ſort were the Shield, the Helmet, the Hauberk or Breſtplate or coate of maile: Of the ſecond ſort were the Sword and Lance; And unto all a horſe muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. Theſe Armes eſpecially the defenſive haue been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly under alteration, for the Breſtplate could not be worne with the coate of maile, and therefore muſt be uſed as occaſion was provided of either; and for this cauſe the ſervice of a Knight is called by ſeverall names; ſometimes from the horſe, ſometimes from the Lance, ſometimes from the Helmet, and not ſeldome from the coat of maile.</p>
               <p>The power of immediate command or calling forth the Knights to their ſervice in its own nature was but miniſteriall and ſubſervient to that power that ordered warre to be leavied: and therefore as in the firſt-Saxon government under their Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo after under their Kings,<note place="margin">Tacitur.</note> warre was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſolved upon, but if it were defenſive, it was by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Lords; if offenſive, by the generall vote of the grand Councell of the Kingdome: ſo by vertue of ſuch order either from the Councell of Lords or grand Councell the Knights were called forth to warre, and others as the caſe required ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:152542:170"/> to a rendezvouz; and this inſtumentall power regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly reſted in the Lords, to whom ſuch ſervice was due; and the Lords were ſummoned by the Lord Paramont, as chiefe of the fee of which their tenants were holden, and not as King or chiefe Captaine in the field; for they were not raiſed by Proclamation, but by ſummons iſſued forth to the Sheriffe, with diſtreſſe; and this onely againſt ſuch as were within his own fee, and held of the Crown. The King therefore might have many Knights at his command, but the Lords more, and if thoſe Lords failed in their due correſpondency with the King, all thoſe of the inferiour orbe were carried away after them, ſo the King is left to ſhift for himſelfe as well as he can; and this might be occaſioned not onely from their tenures by which they ſtood obliged to the inferiour Lords, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly much more by their popularity which was more prevalent by how much Kings looked upon the Commons at a further diſtance in thoſe daies, then in after times, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons interpoſed intentively in the publique government. And thus the Horſemen of <hi>England</hi> becomming leſſe conſtant in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing to their Soveraigne in the field, occaſioned Kings to betake themſelves to their foot, and to forme the ſtrength of their battels wholly in them, and themſelves on foot to engage with them.</p>
               <p>One point of liberty theſe Souldiers by tenure had, which made their ſervice not altogether ſervile, and that was that their ſervice in the field was neither indefinite nor infinite, but circumſcribed by place, time, and end. The time of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the continuance of it was for a ſet time, if it were at their own charges: and although ſome had a ſhorter time, yet the generall ſort were reſtrained to forty daies. For the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of thoſe times conſiſted not in wearying and waſting the Souldier in the field by delayes, and long worke in wheeling about, and retiring, but in playing their prizes like two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of reſolution to get victory by valour, or to die. If upon extraordinary occaſions the warre continued longer then the tenant ſerved upon the pay of the common purſe. The end of the ſervice of the Tenant (<hi>viz.</hi> their Lords defence in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152542:170"/> the defence of the Kingdom) ſtinted their work within certain bounds of place, beyond which they were not to be drawn, unleſſe of their own accord: and theſe were the borders of the Dominion of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which in thoſe daies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into <hi>Scotland</hi> on the North, and into a great part of <hi>France</hi> on the South. And therefore the Earle Marſhall of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (being by <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. commanded by vertue of his tenure to attend in perſon upon the Standart under his Lieutenant that then was to be ſent into <hi>Flanders,</hi> which was no part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>England</hi>) refuſed, and notwithſtanding the Kings threats to hang him, yet he perſiſted ſaying <hi>he would neither goe nor hang.</hi> Not onely becauſe the tenants by Knight ſervice are bound to the defence of their Lords perſons and not of their Lieutenants; but principally becauſe they are to ſerve for the ſafety and defence of the Kingdom; and therefore ought not to be drawn into forraine Countries. Nor did the Earle marſhall onely this,<note place="margin">Walſing. fo. 69. &amp; 71.</note> but many others alſo both Knights and Knights fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, having twenty pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> for all theſe with their armes were ſummoned to ſerve under the Kings pay in <hi>Flanders.</hi> I ſay multitudes of them refuſed to ſerve, and afterwards joyned with the reſt of the Commons in a Petition to the King, and complained of that ſummons, as of a common grievance, be cauſe that neither they nor their anceſtors were bound to ſerve the King in that Countrey, and they obtained the Kings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge under his broad Seale accordingly. The like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be warranted out of the very words of the Statute of Mortmaine,<note place="margin">Stat. Mortm. 7 Edw. 1.</note> which was made within the compaſſe of theſe times, by which it was provided that in caſe Lands be aliened contrary to that Statute, and the immediate Lords doe not ſeiſe the ſame, the King ſhall ſeiſe them, and diſpoſe them for the defence of the Kinodome, <hi>viz.</hi> upon ſuch ſervices reſerved as ſhall ſuite therewith, as if all the ſervice of a Knight muſt conduce thereto; and that he is no further bound to any ſervice of his Lord then will conſiſt with the ſafety of the Kingdome. This was the doctrine that the ſad experience of the later government of Kings in theſe times, had taught the Knighthood of <hi>England</hi> to hold for the future ages.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Tenants in ancient Demeſne and tenants in Burgage are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely acquitted from forraine ſervice; the one becauſe they are in nature of the Kings husbandmen, and ſerved him and his family with victuall: the other becauſe by their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure they were bound to the defence of their burrough, which in account is a limbe or member of the Kingdome, and ſo in nature of a Caſtle guard. Now as touching Clerks and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in Socage holding of a ſubject they are left to the order of ancient uſe appearing upon record. As concerning the Clergy, its evident by what hath been formerly noted, that though they were importunate to be diſcharged of the ſervice military, in regard that their profeſſion was for peace, and not for blood, yet could never obtaine their deſire; for though their perſons might challenge exemption from that worke, yet their Lands were bound to finde armes by their deputies, for otherwiſe it had been unreaſonable that ſo great a part of the Kingdome as the Clergy then had ſhould ſit ſtill and looke on, whiles by the law of nature every one is engaged in his own defence. Nor yet did the profeſſion of theſe men to be men for peace hold alwaies uniforme; ſome kind of warres then were holden ſacred, and wherein they not onely adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured their eſtates, but even their own perſons; and theſe not onely in defenſive way, but by way of invaſion, and many times where no need was for them to appeare. Tenants in Socage alſo in regard of their ſervice might plead exemption from the warres: For if not, the plough muſt ſtand ſtill, and the land thereby become poore and lean: Nevertheleſſe a generall ſervice of defence of the Kingdome is impoſed upon all, and husbandmen muſt be ſouldiers, when the debate is who ſhall have the Land; in ſuch caſes therefore they are <hi>evocati ad arma</hi> to maintaine and defend the Kingdome, but not compelable to forraine ſervice, as the Knights were whoſe ſervice conſiſted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152542:171"/> much in defence of their Lords perſon in reference to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingdome: and many times policy of warre drew the Lords into Armes abroad to keepe the enemy further from their borders, and the Knights then under their Lords pay went along with them; and therefore the ſervice of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is commonly called <hi>ſervitium forinſecum.</hi> Of theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagers did ariſe not onely the body of Engliſh Footmen in their Armies,<note place="margin">Concil. Brit. 406.</note> but the better and more wealthy ſort of them found armes of a Knight, as formerly hath been obſerved, yet alwaies under the pay of the common purſe; and if called out of the Kingdome they were meere voluntiers; for they were not called out by diſtreſſe as Knights were, becauſe they held not their Land by ſuch ſervice; but they were ſummoned by Proclamation, and probably were muſtered by the high Conſtables in each Hundred, the Law nevertheleſſe remaining ſtill intire, that all muſt be done not onely <hi>ad fidem Domini Regis,</hi> but alſo <hi>Regni;</hi> which was diſputed and concluded by the Sword: for though Kings pretended danger to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, often times to raiſe the people; yet the people would give credit as they pleaſed: or if the Kings title were in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or the peoples liberty, yet every man tooke liberty to ſide with that party that liked him beſt; nor did the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation ſway much this or that way.</p>
               <p>Its true that preſidents of thoſe times cry up the Kings power of arraying all ſhips and men without reſpect, unleſſe of age or corporall diſability: but it will appeare that no ſuch array was but in time of no leſſe known danger from abroad to the Kingdome then imminent, and therefore might be wrought more from the generall feare of the enemy, then from the Kings command; and yet thoſe times were alwaies armed in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, and Kings might have pretended continuall cauſe of arraying. Secondly, it will no leſſe clearly appeare, that Kings uſed no ſuch courſe but in caſe of generall danger to the whole Kingdome, either from forraine invaſion, as in the times of King <hi>John,</hi> or from inteſtine broiles,<note place="margin">21 E. 1. rot. 81.</note> as in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the two <hi>Edwards</hi> ſucceſſively: and if the danger threatned onely one coaſt, the array was
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:152542:172"/> limited onely to the parts adjacent thereunto. Thirdly, it ſeemeth that generall arrayes were not levied by diſtreſſe till the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt,<note place="margin">23 E. 1. Memb. 5.</note> and then onely for the rendezvouz at the next Sea coaſt, and for defence againſt forraine inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in which caſe all ſubjects of the Kingdome are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by generall ſervice: otherwiſe it can come unto no other account then that title prerogative, and therein be charactered as a tricke above the ordinary ſtraine. Fourthly, thoſe times brought forth no generall array of all perſons between the ages of ſixteen yeeres and ſixty, that was made by diſtreſſe in any caſe of civill warre, but onely by Sheriffs Summons; and in caſe of diſobedience by ſummons to appeare before the King and his Councell; which ſheweth that by the common law they were not compelable or puniſhable. Laſtly, though theſe arraies of men were ſometimes at the charge of the King, and ſometimes at the ſubjects own charge, yet that laſt was out of the rode way of the Subjects liberty, as the ſubſequent times doe fully manifeſt. And the like may be ſaid of arraies of ſhips, which however under command of Kings for publique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were nevertheleſſe rigged and payed out of the publique charge. The ſumme of all will be, that in caſes of defence from forraine invaſion Kings had power of array according to the order of Law; if they exceeded that rule, it may be more rightly ſaid they did what they would, then what they ought.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LXXI.</hi> Of the Peace.</head>
               <p>WArre and peace are two births by ſeverall venters, and may like the day and night ſucceed, but can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit each to other; and for that cauſe they may claime to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to one father, and that one and the ſame power ſhould act in both: and yet its no good maxime that he that is the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:152542:172"/> chiefe Commander in warre ought to be the chiefe in the order of peace. For it naturally befals that warre, eſpecially that which we call civill warre, like ſome diſeaſes in the body does rather breed ill humours then conſume them, and theſe muſt be purged by dieting the State, and conſtant courſe of juſtice, unto which the rugged waves of warre have little or no affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity if not enmity: Nevertheleſſe the wiſdome of our anceſtors thought it moſt meet to keep their Kings in worke as well in time of peace as of war; and therefore as they anciently referred the principall care thereof to the Lords, who together with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſelect perſons in every County did adminiſter juſtice in ſeverall <hi>iters</hi> or circuits: ſo when Kings had once gotten the name of being chief in civill affaires as they had it in martiall; they ſoon left the Lords behind them (who alſo were willing enough with their own eaſe) and had the name of doing all notwithſtanding it was done by advice of the Lords, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory of Miniſters or commiſſioners thereto deputed. And thus that peace which formerly paſſed under the titles of <hi>Pax Domini, pax vice comitis,</hi> it is <hi>pax Regni,</hi> became by eminency ſwallowed up in that which was called the Kings peace, and the Juſtices called the Kings Juſtices, and himſelf flattered into that title of Fountaine of Juſtice, which belongeth onely to him that is The Moſt High, or Chiefe Law-giver.</p>
               <p>The manner how this honourable care of the ſafety and peace of the Kingdome was imployed, may be referred to a double conſideration, the one in execution of juſtice upon delinquents, the other in preventing occaſions of offence or delinquency, by meanes whereof the publique peace might be endangered. The firſt was acted diverſly according to the preſent ſence of affaires; for what was at firſt done by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their circuits,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> with one hundred of the Commons cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Comites,</hi> and that done <hi>per pagos viceſque</hi> was afterwards done by <hi>itinerant</hi> Judges ſent from the King for the greateſt matters, and by Lords in their Leets, Governours, or chiefe Magiſtrates of Towns in their courts, and Sheriffs in their Tornes, as <hi>Judices ſtati</hi> for the eaſe of the people in matters of leſſe moment. I ſay I conceive it was in the Torne, for I
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152542:173"/> ſuppoſe no emergent court taken up upon occaſion could by the Law draw a neceſſity of a ſudden appearance of all above twelve yeeres of age at the ſame,<note place="margin">52 Hen. 3. Marlb. cap. 25.</note> and for the ſame cauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that one certaine Torne every yeere was holden for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries of homicide, unto which all above twelve yeere of age were to come except Barons, Clergy, and women, or otherwiſe all ſuch had been bound to attendance on every Torne. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the worke of the Tornes continued not to heare and determine as anciently they had done. For in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, and formerly, divers men had priſons to their owne uſe, ſome as Palatines,<note place="margin">Mitor cap. 2. Sec. 9.</note> other as Lords of Franchiſe, and others by power and uſurpation, and had the benefit of all fines inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and by this meanes many were fined that deſerved it not,<note place="margin">Mag. cart. cap. 19.</note> and ſome alſo that deſerved worſe: to prevent which evill <hi>Henry</hi> the third tooke away that power of holding Crown-pleas.<note place="margin">Gloceſt. cap. 8. Weſt. 1. cap. 3.</note> And <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt tooke away their power to determine eſcapes, and left them onely the power of inquiry, and to certifie at the next comming of the Juſtices.</p>
               <p>But theſe injurious times had holden too long to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or laid aſide by ſuch coole purſuit. Men were ſtill ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily impriſoned, and ſo continued oftentimes, till the comming of the Juſtices <hi>itinerant.</hi> For whereas in caſe of bloodſhed the Writ <hi>de odio &amp; gratia</hi> was a remedy; the other had no remedy but by procuring a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer,</hi> which ordinarily was a cure worſe then the hurt.<note place="margin">Stat. Wint. 13 Edw. 1.</note> As a remedy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt found out the new way of making Juſtices of peace, as may appeare by the Statute at <hi>Winton,</hi> which law being purpoſely made for the conſerving of the peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for penalty of crimes already committed (as well as for the ſuppreſſing of future) ordaineth that offences againſt that Law ſhall be preſented to Juſtices aſſigned to enquire thereof; and though theſe at the firſt might be <hi>itinerant,</hi> yet it ſoone made way to reſiant. And before that Statute it ſeemeth the King had found out the way,<note place="margin">Coke Inſt. 4. p. 176</note> if that note be true which is left revived into memory by that honourable reporter, which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the ſixth yeere of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt ſaith, that then <hi>prima fuit inſtitutio juſticiariorum pro pace conſervanda.</hi> And yet ſome
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:152542:173"/> ſemblance there is that it was yet more ancient, even in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. if I miſtake not the ſence of that clauſe in his laws concerning vagabonds; he ordereth that they ſhall be carried <hi>Iuſticiae quae praeeſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hen. 1. cap. 58.</note> although the language be not ſo Clerkly as to ſpeake the ſence out. Now though their worke as yet was but in triall, and they were onely truſted with power of inquiry, yet it induced a new way wherein the Sheriffe was not ſo much as intruſted to intermeddle, and which not onely intermitted the courſe of his proceedings in ſuch matters, but alſo led the way to the diſpoiling of the Sheriffs Torne, and Lords Leets, of that little remainder that was left them of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory power in matters that were againſt the peace, and made their inquiſitory power leſſe regardfull; and eaſed the Juſtices <hi>itinerant</hi> of much of their work in regard they were ſpeedily to certifie up to the King, and ſo theſe matters ſhould be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Parliament, according as thoſe Juſtices were elected in Parliament, who as it ſeemes were jealous of giving the power of determining thoſe offences into any ſudden hand. To ſumme up then the firſt part as touching the puniſhment of offences againſt the peace, the wheele is now in the turning, the Leets and Tornes begin to be ſlighted, the labour of the Juſtices <hi>itinerant</hi> leſſened, the Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer</hi> difuſed by the bringing in of a new order of Juſtices for the peace eſpecially appointed. And the Parliament as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame providors, left as the reſerve for the aſſerting and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ſame, albeit that under it the power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, much reſted upon Juſtices or Judges that attended the Kings court, after that the Common pleas were ſetled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a certain place.</p>
               <p>The preſerving of the peace for the future conſiſted in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and ſuppreſſing riots, routs, unlawfull aſſemblies, and in apprehending and ſecuring of ſuch as were actors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of ſuch deſignes, and other malefactors. And herein we are to conſider, 1. The Laws. 2. The meanes. 3. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power. Concerning the firſt there is no queſtion to be made but that the power of making Laws for the maintenance of the peace reſted in the Parliament, although endeavour
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:152542:174"/> poſſibly might be uſed to ſettle the ſame in the ſole order of the Kings own perſon; and therefore we finde not onely the aſſize of Armes, but generally the ſubſtance of the Statute at <hi>Winton</hi> to be formerly taken up by Proclamation by Kings, predeceſſors to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond who firſt that I can finde put the ſame into the force of a law by Parliament, finding by experience that Proclamations may declare the Kings mind, but not command the peoples wils, although peradventure the thing enjoyned was of ancient uſe, and little inferiour to cuſtome, or Common law. Such are the diſtempers of civill broiles that bring up peace in the reare as a reſerve when their owne ſtrength is waſted, rather then out of any naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination thereto.

By certifying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults. In the firſt is to be conſidered the perſons that are to be aſſeſſed; 2. The Armes; 3. The end. The perſons to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed to Armes are indefinitely ſet down, and comprehend all ſorts, as well bond as free, and others; for ſuch are the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Commiſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the third.<note place="margin">36 Hen. 3. M. Paris poſt adverſaria. Hoveden.</note> But by the Aſſize of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond none were to be armed but free men, and they worth ſixteen or ten Marks in goods at the leaſt: yet their ages are limited; by this Law they muſt be between fifteen yeeres and forty; but by the Commiſſion in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time all between fifteen and ſixty yeeres of age were to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. King <hi>John</hi> arrayed all ſorts, free, bond, and all others that have Armes: or ought to have or can carry Armes;<note place="margin">M Paris Anno 1213.</note> and it ſeems by what hath been formerly noted, that thoſe that were younger then their tenure would beare them out, were accepted into ſervice if they would offer themſelves; but by theſe courſes they though under one and twenty yeeres of age were not onely accepted, but compelled to warre.<note place="margin">Hoveden. Hen. 2. M. Paris addit.</note> Under this title we may alſo touch upon the perſons that were the inſtruments to array theſe men, or rather to arme them; and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152542:175"/> theſe were Juſtices <hi>itinerant,</hi> or one or more Commiſſioners, ſuch as the King found moſt meet for the ſervice; and unto theſe were Commiſſions with inſtructions ſent; and ſometimes Writs were directed onely to the Sheriffs to take with them twelve Knights of the County,<note place="margin">M. Paris. poſt. adverſaria.</note> and to goe into every Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and call before them all ſuch perſons as by the law ought to be aſſeſſed at Armes, and to cauſe them to be ſworn to finde and maintaine Armes in ſuch manner as by the Law they then ſhould be, or formerly were aſſeſſed; and ſometimes the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Armes were ſet down in thoſe Writs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times publiſhed by Proclamation.<note place="margin">M. Paris Anno 1253. &amp; 1256.</note> For Kings found all means little enough to prevaile to bring in alteration of Armes, and of their ſervice, which was a thing not onely troubleſome but chargeable, and whereunto they could not eaſily prevaile to bring the freemen to conſent; and therefore ſometimes the indeavours of Kings in ſuch caſes did not onely meet <hi>dilatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris An. 1253.</note> but alſo <hi>deletionem,</hi> as the Hiſtorians words are, untill the way was found out to declare an eſtabliſhment by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by this Statute made at <hi>Winton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the nature of the eſtabliſhment we are to conſider that the people of <hi>England</hi> were diſtinguiſhed according to their teanures,<note place="margin">Ll. Gulielm. 58.</note> into ſuch as held by Knightſervice, and ſuch as held by Soccage; and that none but thoſe being freeholders could be charged to finde armes according as by the Lawes of the Norman Conquerour may appeare. The eſtabliſhment of Armes for the Knights were eſtabliſhed by their tenures in certainty, and therefore no need was either of aſſeſſment or oath to tie them to finde ſuch Armes; but all the difficulty was for ſuch as were not bound by other tenure then as free born ſubjects, all of whom doe owe to their Country defence and ſo queſtionleſſe had liberty to provide themſelves of ſuch armes as were by common and conſtant uſe held moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious againſt the common enemy, and for the publique de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And that theſe were put in certainty may appeare by the Law of King <hi>VVilliam</hi> formerly noted, and by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the Saxon Laws anciently uſed;<note place="margin">Ll. Aethelſt. c. 16.</note> amongſt others that Law of <hi>Aethelſtane,</hi> that for every plough every man ſhould
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:152542:175"/> finde two compleat horſes. And another order of <hi>Aetheldred</hi> nigh 80 yeeres after differing from it aſſeſſed upon every eight hides of Land a Helmet and a coate of Maile; and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tels us that a Hide is a plough land,<note place="margin">Huntington. An. 1008. Ll. Canut. 97.</note> or ſo much land as one plough can keepe in tilthe one whole yeere; and the reliefe of the Noblemen of all ſorts and ranks in Horſes, Helmets, coates of Maile, Lances, Shields, and Swords, the meaneſt of all which degrees being called <hi>Mediocris Thainus,</hi> yeelding a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe equall to the Armes of a Knight in the times whereof we now treat, <hi>viz.</hi> one Horſe, one Helmet, one coate of Maile, one Lance, one Shield, one Sword; all comprehended under <hi>arma ſua,</hi> as if he had a certaine proper Armes; and the Laws concerning the forfaiture of Armes doe in effect affirme the thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that all men were armed; yet probable it is that Laws were not then ſo often made for the inforcing this or that particular ſort of Armes, in regard that till the Normans time this Iſland was troubled, but ſeldome with any enemies from forraine parts that brought any new ſorts of weapons into faſhion, the Danes and Norwegians being no other then an old acquaintance of theirs. Neither were the Saxons as yet tamed by any enemy ſo farre as to begge a peace, albeit that the Danes had gotten them under. But after the Norman times the Engliſh being ſomewhat overmatched in warre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined more to Husbandry, and began to lay aſide their regard of Armes; and this occaſioned the Kings to make aſſeſſments of Armes; yet having regard to the ancient courſe of the Saxons, ſaving that they urged the uſe of the Bow more then formerly was uſed, and thereby taught the conquered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Conquerours in future ages. Of theſe ſorts of aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before this Statute at <hi>Wintin</hi> I finde but two; the firſt made by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and the other by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, which together with that of this Statute I parallell thus toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their own words.</p>

               <p>I have thus impaled theſe three that the Reader may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcerne how they relate each to other, and ſo may the better underſtand the matter in the ſumme. And I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine three or foure words in them as they are ſet down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can bring up the concluſion, becauſe the miſtake of the ſence of the words hath made ſome miſtake the intent of the thing, and force the ſame to an unwarrantable iſſue.<note place="margin">Lipſius de mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. Rom. lib, 3. Dialog. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Lorica</hi> ſignifies that piece of Armour that defends the breaſt or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the body, and ſometimes is made of plates of Iron, of which ſort I conceive thoſe of the old Germans were (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Hiſtorian maketh mention,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>pauces loricae</hi> he ſaith the Germans had few Armes of defence of their foreparts, and fewer Helmets or Headpieces) for otherwiſe if they had Iron defences for their heads they would not have been content with defences made of Lether for their foreparts, as in the firſt rude times they might have been:<note place="margin">Ciuer. Germ. p. 339. 34.</note> Sometimes its made of links of Iron, and commonly is called a coate of Maile; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it cannot be ſo meant in the aſſeſſments of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and <hi>Henry</hi> the third, becauſe that thoſe of the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are ſaid that they ought to keep <hi>Haubergettum,</hi> or <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgellum,</hi> or <hi>Haubertum;</hi> all which are but ſeverall dialects of one name, and are taken for a coate of Maile: and therefore by the diverſity of names in one and the ſame aſſeſſment I doe conclude that the Armour was not of one and the ſame faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But its evident that by <hi>Hauberk</hi> in the aſſeſſment of the Statute at <hi>Wint.</hi> is meant a coate of Maile, and is never taken for a Breſt-plate or Gorget, as hath been taken upon truſt by ſome that build more weighty concluſions upon that weake principle, then its able to beare; and for the truth hereof, as the word is a French word, ſo I appeale to all French Authors, and ſhall not trouble the reader with the notation of the word, or further about the meaning thereof. In the laſt place, as great miſtake is that alſo of the word <hi>Shapell de ferr,</hi> which is taken by ſome to betoken a breſt-plate of Iron. For the truth whereof the Reader may conſider the Latine word <hi>Capellum</hi> or <hi>Capelletum,</hi> and he ſhall finde that it is an Iron cap, or an ordinary Head-piece: and in the Aſſize of <hi>Henry</hi> the third it
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:152542:177"/> holds the place of <hi>Caſſis</hi> in the Aſſize of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond; for the manner of all theſe let the Reader view the ſculptures of the ſeverall Norman Kings armed for the charge in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their ſeverall reignes, as they are repreſented in <hi>Speeds</hi> Hiſtory. It may alſo be conceived that there is as much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of that weapon which is called <hi>cultellum</hi> or cotell, whiles they tranſlate it by the word Knife, for though it be true that it is one ſignification of that word, yet it appeares not onely by this law that it was a weapon for a Knight in warre, but in uſe at Torniaments, as by that Statute that forbids the uſe of a pointed Sword, or pointed Cottell, a Battoone, or a Mace, at that ſport: and therefore it may ſeem to be ſome weapon of greater uſe, either a Cotellax or ſuch like weapon; otherwiſe to enjoyn the finding of a Knife to a man as an offenſive weapon againſt armed men in battell would ſerve to no uſe at all.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the difference between the ſeverall Aſſizes aforeſaid, it conſiſteth either in the number of the ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees or rankes of thoſe that are aſſeſſed: or ſecondly, in the manner of their valuation: or laſtly, in the particulars of their armes aſſeſſed upon them. As touching the degrees in <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds time, they were but three, in regard that he onely aſſeſſed free-holders; and certainly that was the ancient Law, as by the law of the Conquerour and other Saxon laws for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned may appeare. But <hi>Henry</hi> the third taking example of King <hi>Iohn</hi> who was the firſt founder of generall arrayes charged all but ſuch as were men of nothing; albeit I finde not that ſuch as were of the inferiour degree were ſworn to thoſe Armes, but rather allowed to have them. And though the Statute at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> holdeth to the ſame degrees in Lands, yet in the valew of goods there is ſome difference in favour of them that onely have ſtocke, and no freehold. Secondly, there is ſome difference in the manner of valuation of Lands with Chattels; and therein the Statute at <hi>Winton</hi> favours the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall eſtates more then <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and he more then <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. and yet all of them pretend one rule of ancient cuſtome; I believe they mean that they had it in their eye, but not in their heart: for they would come as nigh to it as they could, and yet keep
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:152542:177"/> as farre from it as they durſt. Thirdly, as touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Armes between theſe three aſſeſſments, it ſeems ſo ſmall as in this they are moſt of all one. For wherein <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. leads, both <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. doe imitate, ſaving that they adde the Horſe and Sword, which queſtionleſſe was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as a granted caſe, that the compleat Armes of a man could not be carried and mannaged without a Horſe, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended without a Sword. As touching other alterations, it might be done upon good advice, as not being deemed meet that ſuch as were no Knights but in eſtate, ſhould be armed in every reſpect like as the Knights were. And thus we have an ancient cuſtome of maintaining Armes by every free man, for the defence of the Kingdome, firſt made uncertaine by the avarice of Kings and negligence of the free men, and brought into an arbitrary charge; at length reduced to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty upon all ſorts of inhabitants by a Statute law (if ſo it then were) unto which every man had yeelded himſelfe bound by his own conſent. But to what end is all this? I ſaid it was for the defence of the Kingdom, and ſo it was in the originall; and yet alſo for the ſafety of the King in order thereunto, and for the ſafety and maintenance of the peace of every member of the whole body. This in one lumpe thus will not down with ſome who will have this aſſeſſment onely to be for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the peace againſt routs and riots, but not ſufficient not intended to be ſupply for warre, when <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt cals for it, becauſe <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt ſhall not have his power confined within the compaſſe of a Statute, but to be at liberty of array as he ſhould think meet; and its not to be denied but the words of this Law runne thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the intent thereof is for preſerving of the peace; but thoſe generall words will not beare the power of a reſtrictive ſence, for certainly the peace is as well preſerved by providing againſt warre as againſt riots; and againſt forraine warre as inteſtine mutinies: and that the Statute intended the one as well as the other will appeare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was made in relation to former preſidents of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and they ſpeak plainly that their intent was to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Kingdome againſt dangers from abroad; the words
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:152542:178"/> of the Hiſtorian are cleare, that <hi>Henry</hi> the third charged all that had 15 <hi>libratas terrae</hi> and upwards ſhould undertake the Armes of a Knight <hi>ut Anglia ſicut Italia militia roboraretur.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M. Paris fo. 926</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had threats from beyond Sea by the defection of the Gaſcoines, therefore he cauſed Writs to iſſue forth throughout the Kingdome that <hi>ſecundam priſtinam conſuetudinem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">M.

M. Paris.</note> Nor are theſe Armes thus aſſeſſed ſo ſlight as men would pretend, for the Armes of the firſt ranke were the compleat Armes of a Knight, and their eſtates equall thereunto; for thoſe 15 <hi>libratae terrae</hi> amounted unto 780 acres of Land, as the late publiſher of <hi>Paris</hi> his Hiſtory hath it; and is very nigh the reckoning of <hi>Henry Huntington,</hi> who (as hath been mentioned) layeth a Helmet and coate of Maile unto eight hides of Land, which according to <hi>Gervaſe</hi> of <hi>Tilburies</hi> account commeth to 800 acres,<note place="margin">Cap. penalt.</note> every Hide containing one hundred acres. Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore were better then Hoblers. And the ſucceeding ranks found Armes alſo proportionable to their eſtates, as conſiderable as the times could finde for ſuch as were of conſtant uſe, and might be ſupplied with other weapons as occaſion ſerved, and as they might be of moſt benefit for the ſervice.</p>
               <p>Furthermore whereas its ſaid that the wiſdome of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament might be queſtioned if they intended no better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt an enemy then againſt a thiefe or rogue, I ſhould deſire the conſideration of thoſe men, whether are thoſe thieves and rogues in Troops or bodies and well armed, or are they a ſort of ſcattered out-lawes lightly armed to flie away, when they have have gotten the prey? If they were in the former poſture, I pray what difference in point of difficulty of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between them and ſo many enemies? and if it was diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Parliament to make this proviſion againſt the one, certainly theſe with the Knighthood of the Kingdome with as much diſcretion will be ſufficient proviſion againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But if theſe be looked upon in the latter ſence, I feare the diſcretion of the Parliament would have been much more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:152542:178"/> in arming all men that have any ability to ſuppreſſe Thieves and Rogues, againſt which the ordinary watch and ward of the Kingdom was an ancient and approved remedy, and ſufficient ſafeguard. And I would fain know of theſe men whither it be for the ſafety of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King to arme the whole body of the people, eſpecially in times of jealouſie for ſuppreſſing of Thieves and Robbers when as it may be done by a guard of known men in every County, with much more eaſe and leſſe charge to the people.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas its endeavoured to make this Statute but a temporary proviſion and taken up for the preſent condition of affaires when Thieves and Robbers went with great ſtrength, and in multitudes. This might be I grant of ſome efficacy, if it had been <hi>introductio novi juris;</hi> but it being grounded upon a former cuſtome, the ground of that cuſtome (which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingdom) muſt be the warrant of the Law; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the preſent inconvenience might be remedied by a preſent order, and needed not the help of a Law that ſhould reſt upon former cuſtome, or provide for future generations. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe if all be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Statute is but a preſent order, that the Armes therein are too ſlight to reſiſt an enemy; and the end thereof was onely to enable the Kingdome againſt Thieves and Robbers; yet could not <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt pretend to have any power to aſſeſſe Armes at pleaſure upon occaſion of warre for the defence of the Kingdome; nor is there any preſident in ſtory that countenanceth it, ſeeing <hi>Henry</hi> the third and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond in their courſe uſed the rule <hi>ſecundum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultates,</hi> as had been formerly obſerved; and the rule fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going tended onely to freemen and their Lands. Nor did King <hi>John</hi> diſclaime the ſame, but purſued it (and yet if there be any preſident of prerogative in ſtory which King <hi>John</hi> had not, that King will be looked upon as a King of wonderment.) I ſay King <hi>John</hi> purſued it when he was in the ſtrength of his diſtemper; threatned by the Pope, provoked by the French King now ready in the field, vexed by his people, and himſelf ſcarce himſelfe, ſummons to defend himſelfe, themſelves,<note place="margin">M Paris An. 1213.</note> and the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> all men that ought to have Armes,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:152542:179"/> or may have Armes, and ſuch as have no amres; and yet <hi>arma ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere poſſint,</hi> let them alſo come <hi>ad capiendum ſolidatas noſtras;</hi> and accordingly there came a vaſt number not onely of the Armed men, but of the unarmed multitude, who afterward were ſent to their own home when victuals failed. Hitherto therefore King <hi>John</hi> not above three yeeres before his death held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the aſſeſſment to Armes onely of ſuch as had Lands; and at this time of exigency others unarmed were ſummoned to take Armes from the King with their pay, or otherwiſe they muſt fight without weapons.</p>
               <p>I am now come to the laſt generall point which concerneth the executive power of matters concerning the peace within this law, touching which the Statute inforceth this, that Conſtables in every Hundred and Franchiſe ſhall have the view of Armes, and ſhall preſent defaults againſt the Statute of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices aſſigned, who ſhall certifie the ſame to the King in every Parliament, and the King ſhall provide remedy; whereby it ſeemeth manifeſt that hitherto no law or cuſtome was made againſt any for default of Armes, but onely ſuch as held by that tenure: and therefore they had a ſhift to cauſe them to ſweare to maintaine Armes, and ſo might proceed upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, as in caſe of perjury; and that the Parliament was ſtill loath to ſet any certaine rule for penalty, and abſolutely decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, and left it under a generall <hi>periculo incumbente,</hi> which its likely men would rather eſchew by obedience, then adventure upon out of a daring ſpirit, unleſſe their caſe was very cleere within the mercy of common reaſon; and therefore ſuch caſes were left to ſpeciall order of the Parliament rather then they would deliver ſuch a rod as determining power was over into any uncertaine hand what ever. It is very true that by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome this alſo hath been controverted, as if all the executive power had been turned out of the Parliaments or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the directory of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, which thing reacheth farre; for then in order thereunto the whole Militia of the Kingdome muſt have been under his ſafe command: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ever entred into the conceipt of that King I know not, but ſomewhat like thereunto is not obſcurely urged to nouriſh
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:152542:179"/> and ſuggeſt ſuch a kind of notion, and ſo derive it unto his ſucceſſors upon the words of a Statute <hi>de defenſione portandi armorum</hi> the Engliſh whereof I ſhall render out of the French, as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It belongeth to us</hi> (viz. Edw. 1.) <hi>and from us by our Royall Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory to defend force of Armes, and all other force againſt our peace at all times that we ſhall pleaſe, and to puniſh according to the laws and uſages of this Realm, ſuch as ſhall oppoſe, and to this they</hi> (viz. Lords and Commons) <hi>are bound us to ayd as their good Lord, alwaies when need ſhall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things are concurrant with this, which is the body of the Statute (if ſuch it be;) the one is the preface, or the occaſion: and the ſecond is the concluſion upon the whole body of the ſame. The preface firſt ſet down the inſcription or direction of the Law; not to the people but to the Juſtices of his bench, and ſo its in nature of a Writ or Declaration ſent unto his Judges. Then it ſets down the occaſion which was a debate between <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and his Lords with a Treaty, which was had before certaine perſons deputed thereto: and it was accorded, that at the next Parliament Order ſhall be taken by common conſent of the King, the Prelates, Earles, and Barons, that in all Parliaments treaties and other aſſemblies which ſhall be had in the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> for ever after, all men ſhall come thereto without force, and without Armes, well and peaceably; and thence it recites that the ſaid meeting at Parliament was had, and that there the Prelates, Earles, Barons, and Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty being aſſembled to adviſe upon this matter; <hi>nous eiont dit</hi> ſaith one coppy, and <hi>nous eions dit</hi> ſaith another coppy; ſo as whether this was the Declaration of the King unto the Parliament, or of the Parliament to the King is one doubt, and a principall one it is in ſuch a caſe as this. Then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all is that the King commandeth theſe things ſhall be read before the Juſtices in the bench, and there enrolled; and this is dated the 30. of <hi>October</hi> in the ſeventh yeere of his reigne, which was <hi>Ann.</hi> 1279. So as if it were the Declaration of the King, then it implieth as if it were not very well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Parliament; and therefore the King would have it
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:152542:180"/> reſt upon record in nature of a claime or <hi>proteſtando</hi> for ſaving the prerogative of the Crown. But if it were the Declaration of the Parliament the King held it ſo precious a flower, that fearing it ſhould fade ſet it in a private Garden of his owne, that it might be more carefully nurſed againſt the blaſt of time; as if the Parliament had not aſſented thereto, (or if they did) meaned not to hold it forth to the world for future times to be a conſtant rule, but onely by way of conceſſion, to eaſe themſelves of the preſent difficulty, in making a Law againſt wearing of Armour in ordinary civill affaires, and ſo referred it to the Kings care to provide againſt imergent breach of the peace, as an expedient for the preſent inconveniences in affairs. And it will well ſuite with the poſture of affaires then in courſe, for the Welſh warres were now intermitted, and a quiet of three yeeres enſued; in the middeſt of which Souldiers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liberty to doe nothing (and that is next to naught) but recreate themſelves, uſed their wonted guiſe, as if they were not dreſſed that day that they were not armed; nor fit for counſell, unleſſe (as their anceſters) with weapons in their hands, nor worthy of the preſence of a King under other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then as a Generall in the field, and themſelves as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders that are never a <hi>la mode;</hi> but when all in Iron and Steele. I ſay to make a Law that muſt ſuddenly binde men from riding or being armed when no man thought himſelfe ſafe otherwiſe was in effect to expoſe their bare necks to the next turne of the Sword of a King that they did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much truſt, and the leſſe in regard he truſted not them. I doe not wonder therefore if the Parliament liked not the worke, but left it to the King to provide for the keeping off breaches of the peace, and promiſed there aſſiſtance therein.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſing all that is or can be ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Parliament had given up the power of the Militia unto <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, yet it was not to all intents, nor did it continue; for beſides the Statute of Torniments, which ſheweth plainly that the ordering of Armour was in the power of the Parliament, and which in all probabilty was made after that law laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned; the Statute at <hi>VVinton</hi> made after this Law
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:152542:180"/> nigh ſix yeeres ſpace ordereth the uſe of the Trained bands in maintaining the peace, and reſerveth the penalties to themſelves for any default committed againſt the ſaid act. And therefore notwithſtanding any thing that yet appeareth to me out of any Law or Hiſtory, the chiefe moderatorſhip of warre and peace within the Realm of <hi>England</hi> reſteth hitherto upon the Parliament next under God, and in the King no otherwiſe then in order to the publique, the rule whereof can be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by no other Judge then that which can be intended to have no other reſpect then the publique good; and which is the abridgement of the large volume of the Kingdom.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>A ſummary concluſion.</head>
               <p>ANd thus have I brought the ſhape of Engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (rude as it is) from the firſt off-ſpring of the Saxons through the rough waves of the Daniſh tempeſts, the rocks of Norman invaſion; and the Quickſands of Arbitrary government under Popes and Kings to the Haven; much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced it is I confeſſe by the rage of time, and yet retained the originall likeneſſe in proportion.</p>
               <p>Kings firſt (about the Norman times) joyning with the Lords for their joynt intereſt above the ordinary pitch had mounted each other too high to be Lords over free men; Then by flattering of the free men into their deſignes hovered above them all; but not being able to maintaine their pitch ſo long as the Lords held together, ſtooped for a party amongſt them and ſoon obtained their deſire. For ſome Lords (more ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then others, and they againe more populer then them) ſeeke ſeverall intereſts: And thus Kings (aided by their party to a Supremacy which they were never borne to; and it by them into a preheminence above their Peeres which neither law nor cuſtome ever gave them) are of Moderators in the Councell of Lords, become moderators of thoſe Councels;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:152542:181"/> and ſo they obtained all that the Lords had, but no more. For though both they and the Lords abuſed their power over the free men by extorſion and opreſſion as Lords over tenants; yet could they never prevaile over them as free born ſubjects to gaine their conſent to give their right, or the law up to the Kings beck; but ſtill that remained arbiter both of King and people, and the Parliament Supreame expounder and Judge both of it and them. Other argument hereof there will be little need,<note place="margin">Bract. lib. 2. c. p. 16.</note> beſides what hath formerly appeared, then what we finde in <hi>Bracton</hi> who wrote in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, to this effect: <hi>God is ſuperiour to the King, and the Law by which he is made King, and his Court,</hi> viz. <hi>the Earles and Barons: Earles (according to their name Comites) are the Kings aſſociates, and he that hath an aſſociate hath a maſter; and therefore if the King be unbridled (or which is all one) without Law, they ought to bridle him, unleſſe they will be unbridled as the King, and then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons may cry Lo Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> This was the judgement of that famous Lawyer of the State of an Engliſh King in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time, I ſhall adde hereto a concurrent teſtimony of a Lawyer alſo in <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt time. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the King ought to have no equall in the Land:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings Anſwer:</hi> I this doe grant and promiſe.</p>
               <p>In few words the King promiſed to keep the lawes already made, the peace of his Kingdome, and the Laws to be agreed upon by the commonalty: the ſame in ſubſiſtance with that of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Conquerour; the Daniſh and Saxon Kings formerly had, and in the foregoing diſcourſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: And thus is he led to the Throne in a Chaine of Gold, a ſerious memoriall of the Kings duty as he is a man, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ornament to him as a King. If then the King be under the law in caſe of direction, as by ſtipulation he is bound, if he be likewiſe under the Law in caſe of tranſgreſſion to be judged by his <hi>Comites</hi> or Peeres. Hitherto certainly an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh King is but <hi>Primus inter omnes,</hi> and not <hi>ſupra totum;</hi> and if at any time he skipped higher, he afterwards fell lower; for it was the lot of theſe times to have Lords that were bent to worke the people to regard their own liberties, in which the Lords had firſt wrapped up their own claimes. Thus comes the counſels of ſuch as have been notoriouſly exorbitant to be ſcanned; and to bring theſe into frame, all runne out of frame; the Barons warres ariſe, and thrive according as intereſts doe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:152542:182"/> concenter more or leſſe; the iſſue is like that of a drawn bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, wherein he that continueth laſt in the field is glad to be gone away, and ſo the Title is left to be tried upon the next advantage that ſhall ariſe.</p>
               <p>Yet had Kings gotten one ſtep forwards to their deſigne, which was that they now had to deale with a divided Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. It was the birth of ambition, and it was nouriſhed by the ſame milke; for thoſe that ſide with the King are become Magnificoes next to the Kings perſon, and the ſole managers of all the great affaires of State concurrant with their own deſignes under-board. But the other Lords are in account ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſtanding further off, and looking on at a diſtance, are laid away as ſupurfluous: and as they themſelves are out of the game of great men, ſo grow they mindleſſe of their intereſt in the great affaires, yet of theſe there is diverſity, for ſome ſport themſelves in their condition; others obſerve the irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe above, and watch their owne time.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt advance of that ſociety, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called the Privy-Councell; being a company of choiſe men according to the Kings bent, unto whom the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the weighty affaires of the Kingdome is committed; but nothing can be concluded without the Kings <hi>fiat,</hi> which regularly ſhould follow upon the premiſſes, according to the major vote; but more ordinarily ſuteth with that which beſt ſuteth with his pleaſure. And now are Parliaments looked on as fatall, or at the beſt, but as heavy dull debates, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient both for ſpeed and ſecrecy; which indeed are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for weake and unwarrantable counſels, but ſuch as are well grounded upon truth, and ſtrength of reaſon of State care not to behold the cleareſt noon-day, and prevaile neither by ſpeed nor ſecrecy, but by the power of uncontrolled Reaſon, fetcht from truth it ſelfe. The grand Councell of Lords alſo are now no leſſe burthenſome: For though they were not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile againſt the private deſignes of an arbitrary Supremacy, yet doe they hinder the progreſſe, tell tailes to the people, and blot the names of thoſe that are of that aſpiring humour; which once done, like that of <hi>Siſiphus</hi> they have no other end of there labour then their toile.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:152542:182"/>
               <p>Thus periſhed that ancient and rightly honourable Grand Councell of Lords, having firſt layd aſide the publique then loſt unity, and laſtly themſelves; beſides the extreame danger of the whole body. For the ſence of State once contracted into a Privy councell is ſoon recontracted into a Cabinet councell, and laſt of all into a Favourite or two, which many times brings dammage to the Publique, and both themſelves and Kings into extream <hi>praecipices;</hi> partly for want of maturity, but principally through the providence of God over-ruling irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courſes, to the hurt of ſuch as walke in them.</p>
               <p>Nor were the Clergy idle in this buſtle of affaires, although not very well imployed; for it is not to be imagined but that theſe private prizes plaied between the Lords, Commons, and King, laid each other open to the ayme of a forraine preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiles they lay at their cloſe guard one againſt another: and this made an Eccleſiaſticall power to grow upon the Civil, like the Ivy upon the Oake from being ſervants to friends, and thence Lords of Lords, and Kings of Kings: By the firſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth it might ſeem to be a Spirituall Kingdome, but in the bloſome which now is come to ſome luſtre its evident to be nothing but a temporall Monarchy over the conſciences of men; and ſo like Cuckows laying their egges in neſts that are none of their own, they have their brood brought up at the publique charge. Nevertheleſſe, this their Monarchy was as yet beyond their reach; it was Prelacy that they laboured for, pretending to the Popes uſe; but in order to themſelves. The cripple eſpied their halting, and made them ſoon tread after his pace; he is content thty ſhould be Prelates, without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, within their ſeverall Dioceſſes and Provinces, ſo as he may be the ſole <hi>Praelatiſſimo</hi> beyond all compariſon; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly thus had been before theſe times deſtroyed the very principles of the Church-government of this Kingdome, but that two things preiudiced the worke: the one that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palty was a forraine power, and the other that as yet the Pope was entangled with the power of Councels, if he did not ſtoop thereunto. The firſt of theſe two was the moſt deadly Herbe in the Pottage, and made it ſo unſavoury that it could never
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:152542:183"/> be digeſted in this Kingdome: For Kings looking upon this as an intrenchment upon their prerogative, and the people alſo as an intrenchment upon their liberties, both or one of them were ever upon the guard to keep out that which was without, and would be ruled neither by Law nor Councell. And thetefore though both Kings and people yeelded much unto the importunity of theſe men, and gave them many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges whereby they became great; yet was their greatneſſe dependant upon the law of the Land and vote of Parliament; and though they had the more power they nevertheleſſe were not one jot the more abſolute, but ſtill the law kept above their top; I deny not but they in their practice exceeded the rule often and lifted themſelves above their ranke; yet it is as well to be granted that they could never make law to bind the Church-men, much leſſe the Laity, but by conjunction of the grand councels both for Church and Common-wealth affaires; nor could they execute any Law in caſe that concerned the liberty or propriety of either, but in a Synodicall way, or as deputed by the Parliament in that manner. And therefore I muſt conclude that in theſe times whereof we treat the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Church-government, ſo farre as warranted by law, were in their nature Presbyteriall; that is, both in making laws and executing them; Biſhops and Archbiſhops were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truſted with the ſole adminiſtration of them, but in and by conſent of Synods in which the Clergy and Laity ought to have their joynt vote; and all power more or contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to was at the beſt an uſurpation coloured by practiſe, which was eaſily attained where there was a perpetuall moderatorſhip reſting in the Biſhop, and over all the Pope; the King, Lords, and Commons in the mean while being buried in purſuit of ſeverall intereſts elſewhere.</p>
               <p>To make all ſemblable, the free men met with the ſad influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe diſtempers, as wel from the King and Lords, as the Clergy. Kings to ſave their own ſtake from the Pope, remitted of that protection which they owed to their Subjects, and let in upon them a flood of oppreſſions and extortions from the Romiſh and Engliſh Clergy, and ſo like a little ſhip caſt out a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:152542:183"/> barrell for the Whale to peruſe till it gets away: but this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no right. The Lords by their partees ſhattered them a ſunder and diſmembered their body by inteſtine broiles. The Clergy more craftily making ſome of them free Deniſins of the Roman See, and taking them into their protection whiles others of the free men at a diſtance were expoſed as a prey to the continuall aſſaults of thoſe devouring times: all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together to deface and deſtroy that ancient and goodly bond of brotherhood, the Law of Decenners, by which the free men formerly holden together like Cement in a ſtrong wall, are now left like a heape of looſe ſtones, or ſo many ſingle men ſcarcely eſcaping with their skinne of liberties, and thoſe invaded by many projects and ſhifts in government of State affaires. So muſt I leave them untill ſome happy hand ſhall worke their repaire both for time and manner, as it ſhall pleaſe <hi>that great and wiſe Maſter builder of the World.</hi>
